AB  - As a consequence of conditioning visual cues with delayed reward,
      cue-evoked neural activity that predicts the time of expected future
      reward emerges in the primary visual cortex (V1). We hypothesized that
      this reward-timing activity is engendered by a reinforcement signal
      conveying reward acquisition to V1. In lieu of behavioral conditioning, we
      assessed in vivo whether selective activation of either basal forebrain
      (BF) or cholinergic innervation is sufficient to condition cued
      interval-timing activity. Substituting for actual reward, optogenetic
      activation of BF or cholinergic input within V1 at fixed delays following
      visual stimulation entrains neural responses that mimic behaviorally
      conditioned reward-timing activity. Optogenetically conditioned neural
      responses express cue-evoked temporal intervals that correspond to the
      conditioning intervals, are bidirectionally modifiable, display
      experience-dependent refinement, and exhibit a scale invariance to the
      encoded delay. Our results demonstrate that the activation of BF or
      cholinergic input within V1 is sufficient to encode cued interval-timing
      activity and indicate that V1 itself is a substrate for associative
      learning that may inform the timing of visually cued behaviors.

AB  - Normative theories posit that value-based decision-making is context
      independent. However, decisions between two high-value options can be
      suboptimally biased by the introduction of a third low-value option. This
      context-dependent modulation is consistent with the divisive normalization
      of the value of each stimulus by the total value of all stimuli. In
      addition, an independent line of research demonstrates that pairing a
      stimulus with a high-value outcome can lead to attentional capture that
      can mediate the efficiency of visual information processing. Here we
      tested the hypothesis that value-based attentional capture interacts with
      value-based normalization to influence the optimality of decision-making.
      We used a binary-choice paradigm in which observers selected between two
      targets and the color of each target indicated the magnitude of their
      reward potential. Observers also had to simultaneously ignore a
      task-irrelevant distractor rendered in a color that was previously
      associated with a specific reward magnitude. When the color of the
      task-irrelevant distractor was previously associated with a high reward,
      observers responded more slowly and less optimally. Moreover, as the
      learned value of the distractor increased, electrophysiological data
      revealed an attenuation of the lateralized N1 and N2Pc responses evoked by
      the relevant choice stimuli and an attenuation of the late positive
      deflection (LPD). Collectively, these behavioral and electrophysiological
      data suggest that value-based attentional capture and value-based
      normalization jointly mediate the influence of context on free-choice
      decision-making.

AB  - ▪ Abstract Recent progress in the study of attention and performance is
      discussed, focusing on the nature of attentional control and the effects
      of practice. Generally speaking, the effects of mental set are proving
      more pervasive than was previously suspected, whereas automaticity is
      proving less robust. Stimulus attributes (e.g. onsets, transients) thought
      to have a “wired-in” ability to capture attention automatically have been
      shown to capture attention only as a consequence of voluntarily adopted
      task sets. Recent research suggests that practice does not have as
      dramatic effects as is commonly believed. While it may turn out that some
      mental operations are automatized in the strongest sense, this may be
      uncommon. Recent work on task switching is also described; optimal
      engagement in a task set is proving to be intimately tied to learning
      operations triggered by the actual performance of a new task, not merely
      the anticipation of such performance.

AB  - Many brain-imaging studies are designed with the goal of isolating brain
      regions responsible for a specific mental function. The results, which
      reveal islands of activity scattered about the brain, can give the
      impression that the brain is just a disorganized collection of specialized
      processing centers. However, examination of how brain activity changes as
      a new skill is learned reveals a structured learning architecture composed
      of three hierarchically organized systems, each with a distinct role in
      learning and each characterized by a distinct pattern of
      learning-dependent plasticity. These systems are a representation system,
      which supports associative learning; a cognitive control network, which
      allocates attention during the execution of newly learned behaviors; and a
      metacognitive system, which guides the establishment of new behavioral
      routines, monitors the quality of ongoing behaviors, and oversees the
      transitions from one behavior to another. The combined involvement of
      these systems allows humans to learn rapidly and to flexibly transfer
      existing knowledge to novel contexts.

AB  - Zellner's g prior remains a popular conventional prior for use in Bayesian
      variable selection, despite several undesirable consistency issues. In
      this article we study mixtures of g priors as an alternative to default g
      priors that resolve many of the problems with the original formulation
      while maintaining the computational tractability that has made the g prior
      so popular. We present theoretical properties of the mixture g priors and
      provide real and simulated examples to compare the mixture formulation
      with fixed g priors, empirical Bayes approaches, and other default
      procedures. Please see Arnold Zellner's letter and the author's response.

AB  - There have been no investigations as to how people respond to sequences of
      events which occur at brief, unpredictable intervals as in everyday life.
      Eleven young adults were practised at a two-choice, continuous, serial
      choice-response task in which intervals between each response and the
      onset of the next signal (RSIs) varied randomly from trial to trial. On
      half the trials in each of four conditions the RSI was 20 ms, and on the
      other trials 200, 400, 800 and 1600 ms respectively. Reaction times fell
      as RSIs increased from 20-200 ms but thereafter appeared to be unaffected
      by RSI duration. In the 20/200 and 20/400 ms RSI conditions RT was not
      affected by transitions between different RSIs but in the 20/800 and
      20/1600 ms conditions RTs were faster when the longer RSI recurred on
      immediately successive trials than if the long RSI followed the short (20
      ms) RSI. These results are discussed in terms of a control system model
      for the way in which subjects actively trade off between their internal
      performance limitations to optimally meet task demands.

AB  - Two experiments examined visual orienting in response to spatial precues.
      In Experiment 1A participants were informed that targets usually (p =.8)
      appeared on the same side as cues in a particular colour (e.g., red).
      Rapid orienting was observed, with both central and peripherally presented
      cues. In Experiment IB cue displays were spatially symmetric. Participants
      were informed that target location (left or right) was usually predicted
      (p =.8) by cue colour (red or green). Orienting effects were observed, but
      these were slower to develop and much weaker than in Experiment 1 A. In
      Experiment 2A and 2B the cue was a single, centrally presented letter. We
      compared effects of spatially symmetric (T, X, v, o) and asymmetric (d, b)
      letter cues. Validity effects were present for asymmetric cues, but
      entirely absent for symmetric cues. These finding are discussed in terms
      of Lambert and Duddy's (2002) proposal that spatial correspondence
      learning plays a critical role in spatial precueing. Implications of the
      results for the distinction between endogenous and exogenous orienting are
      also considered.

AB  - Learners exhibit many apparently irrational behaviors in their use of
      cues, sometimes learning to ignore relevant cues or to attend to
      irrelevant ones. A learning phenomenon called highlighting seems
      especially to demand explanation in terms of learned attention.
      Highlighting complements the classic phenomenon of conditioned blocking,
      which has been shown to involve learned inattention. Highlighting and
      blocking, along with a wide spectrum of other perplexing learning
      phenomena, can be accounted for by recent connectionist models in which
      both attentional shifting and associative learning are driven by the
      rational goal of rapid error reduction.

AB  - Two experiments investigated performance of instrumental lever pressing by
      rats following post-conditioning devaluation of the sucrose reinforcer
      produced by establishing an aversion to it. In Experiment I rats responded
      less in an extinction test after being averted from the sucrose following
      training on a ratio schedule, but not following an equivalent amount of
      training on an interval schedule. This was true even though the devalued
      sucrose would not act as an effective reinforcer on either the ratio or
      interval schedule. Experiment II provided a further investigation of the
      insensitivity of interval responding to reinforcer devaluation by
      comparing test performance under simple extinction with responding when
      the devalued reinforcer was presented on either a response-contingent or
      non-contingent schedule during the test. Once again simple extinction
      performance was unaffected by prior reinforcer devaluation. Furthermore,
      neither non-contingent nor contingent presentations of the devalued
      reinforcer significantly depressed responding below the level seen in the
      extinction condition. Ratio, but not interval performance appears to be
      controlled by knowledge about the instrumental contingency that encodes
      specific properties of the training reinforcer.

AB  - Attention alters three key properties of population neural activity -
      firing rate, rate variability, and shared variability between neurons. All
      three properties are well explained by a single canonical computation -
      normalization - that acts across hierarchically integrated brain systems.
      Combining data from rodents and nonhuman primates, we argue that cortical
      cholinergic modulation originating from the basal forebrain closely mimics
      the effects of directed attention on these three properties of population
      neural activity. Cholinergic modulation of the cortical microcircuit
      underlying normalization may represent a key biological basis for the
      rapid and flexible changes in population neuronal coding that are required
      by directed attention.

AB  - Abstract An experiment is described in which the subject sat facing a
      display of two neon bulbs. When the left-hand bulb lit he pressed a key
      under his left hand, and when the right hand bulb lit he pressed a key
      under his right hand. The left-hand bulb gave brief flashes at random
      intervals averaging about 4 sec. The right-hand bulb gave a brief flash at
      regular intervals of about 4 sec. The experiment repeats (the author
      believes for the first time) certain essential conditions of Vince's
      (1948, 1950) experiments and, following detailed scrutiny of every pair of
      responses, is taken as evidence for the following statements:? (a) The
      response to a signal arriving during the reaction time to a former signal
      will be delayed by an amount approximately equal to the time elapsing
      between the arrival of the signal and the end of the reaction time to the
      former signal. (b) An exception to this may occur when two signals arrive
      close together. In this case the two signals may be responded to as a
      single group. (c) Delays can be occasioned by the monitoring of responses
      as well as by reactions to signals. (d) ?Grouping? of signal and

AB  - Recent studies have shown that reward history acts as a powerful
      attentional bias, even overcoming top-down goals. This has led to the
      suggestion that rewards belong to a class of attentional cues based on
      selection history, which are defined by past outcomes with a stimulus
      feature. Selection history is thought to be separate from traditional
      attentional cues based on physical salience and voluntary goals, but there
      is relatively little understanding of how selection history operates as a
      mechanism of attentional selection. Critically, it has yet to be
      understood how multiple sources of selection history interact when
      presented simultaneously. For example, it may be easier to find something
      we like if it also appears in a predictable location. We therefore pitted
      spatial probabilities against reward associations and found that the two
      sources of information had independent and additive effects. Additionally,
      the strength of the two sources in biasing attentional selection could be
      equated. In contrast, while a nonpredictive but perceptually salient cue
      also exhibited independent and additive effects with reward, reward
      associations dominated the perceptually salient cue at all levels. Our
      data indicate that reward associations are part of a class of particularly
      potent attentional cues that guide behavior through learned expectations.
      However, selection history should not be thought of as a unitary concept
      but should be understood as a collection of independent sources of
      information that bias attention in a similar fashion.

AB  - People often have trouble performing 2 relatively simple tasks
      concurrently. The causes of this interference and its implications for the
      nature of attentional limitations have been controversial for 40 years,
      but recent experimental findings are beginning to provide some answers.
      Studies of the psychological refractory period effect indicate a stubborn
      bottleneck encompassing the process of choosing actions and probably
      memory retrieval generally, together with certain other cognitive
      operations. Other limitations associated with task preparation,
      sensory-perceptual processes, and timing can generate additional and
      distinct forms of interference. These conclusions challenge widely
      accepted ideas about attentional resources and probe reaction time
      methodologies. They also suggest new ways of thinking about continuous
      dual-task performance, effects of extraneous stimulation (e.g., stop
      signals), and automaticity. Implications for higher mental processes are
      discussed.

AB  - Memory can strongly influence how attention is deployed in future
      encounters. Though memory dependent on the medial temporal lobes has been
      shown to drive attention, how other memory systems could concurrently and
      comparably enhance attention is less clear. Here, we demonstrate that both
      reinforcement learning and context memory facilitate attention in a visual
      search task. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we dissociate
      the mechanisms by which these memories guide attention: trial by trial,
      the hippocampus (not the striatum) predicted attention benefits from
      context memory, while the striatum (not the hippocampus) predicted
      facilitation from rewarded stimulus-response associations. Responses in
      these regions were also distinctly correlated with individual differences
      in each type of memory-guided attention. This study provides novel
      evidence for the role of the striatum in guiding attention, dissociable
      from hippocampus-dependent context memory.

AB  - This review outlines recent findings from human neuroimaging concerning
      the role of a highly interconnected network of brain areas including
      orbital and medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, striatum and dopaminergic
      mid-brain in reward processing. Distinct reward-related functions can be
      attributed to different components of this network. Orbitofrontal cortex
      is involved in coding stimulus reward value and in concert with the
      amygdala and ventral striatum is implicated in representing predicted
      future reward. Such representations can be used to guide action selection
      for reward, a process that depends, at least in part, on orbital and
      medial prefrontal cortex as well as dorsal striatum.

AB  - We discovered that when adult rats experience an association between
      visual stimuli and subsequent rewards, the responses of a substantial
      fraction of neurons in the primary visual cortex evolve from those that
      relate solely to the physical attributes of the stimuli to those that
      accurately predict the timing of reward. In addition to revealing a
      remarkable type of response plasticity in adult V1, these data demonstrate
      that reward-timing activity-a "higher" brain function-can occur very early
      in sensory-processing paths. These findings challenge the traditional
      interpretation of activity in the primary visual cortex.

AB  - Instrumental behaviour is controlled by two systems: a stimulus-response
      habit mechanism and a goal-directed process that involves two forms of
      learning. The first is learning about the instrumental contingency between
      the response and reward, whereas the second consists of the acquisition of
      incentive value by the reward. Evidence for contingency learning comes
      from studies of reward devaluation and from demonstrations that
      instrumental performance is sensitive not only the probability of
      contiguous reward but also to the probability of unpaired rewards. The
      process of incentive learning is evident in the acquisition of control
      over performance by primary motivational states. Preliminary lesion
      studies of the rat suggest that the prelimbic area of prefrontal cortex
      plays a role in the contingency learning, whereas the incentive learning
      for food rewards involves the insular cortex.

AB  - Parietal brain regions have been implicated in reorienting of visuospatial
      attention in location-cueing paradigms when misleading advance information
      is provided in form of a spatially invalid cue. The difference in reaction
      times to invalidly and validly cued targets is termed the "validity
      effect" and used as a behavioral measure for attentional reorienting.
      Behavioral studies suggest that the magnitude of the validity effect
      depends on the ratio of validly to invalidly cued targets (termed cue
      validity), i.e., on the amount of top-down information provided. Using
      fMRI, we investigated the effects of a cue validity manipulation upon the
      neural mechanisms underlying attentional reorienting using valid and
      invalid spatial cues in the context of 90% and 60% cue validity,
      respectively. We hypothesized that increased parietal activation would be
      elicited when subjects need to reorient their attention in a context of
      high cue validity. Behaviorally, subjects showed significantly higher
      validity effects in the high as compared to the low cue validity
      condition, indicating slower reorienting. The neuroimaging data revealed
      higher activation of right inferior parietal and right frontal cortex in
      the 90% than in the 60% cue validity condition. We conclude that the
      amount of top-down information provided by predictive cues influences the
      neural correlates of reorienting of visuospatial attention by modulating
      activation of a right fronto-parietal attentional network.

AB  - Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a system
      capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the experimenter.
      Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that indicates
      where in the visual field the signal will occur. This shift in efficiency
      appears to be due to an alignment (orienting) of the central attentional
      system with the pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would
      also be possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced
      criterion at the expected target position. However, this description
      ignores important constraints about the way in which expectancy improves
      performance. First, when subjects are cued on each trial, they show
      stronger expectancy effects than when a probable position is held constant
      for a block, indicating the active nature of the expectancy. Second, while
      information on spatial position improves performance, information on the
      form of the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to improvements
      in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth, there appears to be
      little ability to lower the criterion at two positions that are not
      spatially contiguous. A framework involving the employment of a
      limited-capacity attentional mechanism seems to capture these constraints
      better than the more general language of criterion setting. Using this
      framework, we find that attention shifts are not closely related to the
      saccadic eye movement system. For luminance detection the retina appears
      to be equipotential with respect to attention shifts, since costs to
      unexpected stimuli are similar whether foveal or peripheral. These results
      appear to provide an important model system for the study of the
      relationship between attention and the structure of the visual system.

AB  - This study was performed to gain a better understanding of EEG frequency
      analysis test-retest reliability in normal healthy adults, and to evaluate
      factors which could influence the measured inter-record differences.
      Nineteen subjects underwent serial EEG recordings at 5 min and 12-16 week
      intervals. Records were visually edited using a standardized protocol, and
      FFT frequency analysis performed on segments of 60, 40, or 20 sec total
      length. Correlation coefficients for broad band features averaged 0.92
      over the 5 min retest interval and 0.84 over the 12-16 week interval.
      There was essentially no difference between correlation coefficients of
      absolute and relative power features. Coefficients based on 60 sec records
      were marginally higher than those of 40 or 20 sec records. On the other
      hand, test-retest percent differences were typically lower for relative as
      opposed to absolute power features, and 60 sec records showed consistently
      lower percent differences than did 40 or particularly 20 sec records. Peak
      alpha frequency and mean frequency were the most stable EEG features at
      either interval. Montage had significant effects on test-retest
      differences at the 12-16 week interval. A significant association between
      intra-record and inter-record variability could not be demonstrated.

AB  - Since refractory phase is regarded as a universal post-stimulation
      phenomenon of sensitive tissues, the question arises whether a similar
      effect may be observed which is characteristic of voluntary and
      associative responses. Three sets of experiments were made, using reaction
      time, judging the longer of two parallel lines, and nonsense
      syllable-number sequences after the method employed by Thorndike.
      Variations in the interims between stimulations were introduced. These
      ranged from ½ sec. to 16 sec. The author's results led him to conclude
      that in the case of the three processes studied effects are produced in
      the organism which "serve as a barrier against immediate repetition." The
      subsequent return to "normality" is comparable to that found in isolated
      tissues and reflexes, and while it may not be identical with refractory
      phase in nerve-muscle preparations, it is probably based upon it.

AB  - Can people learn to perform two tasks at the same time without
      interference? To answer this question, the authors trained 6 participants
      for 36 sessions in a Psychological Refractory Period (PRP) experiment,
      where Task 1 required a speeded vocal response to an auditory stimulus and
      Task 2 required a speeded manual response to a visual stimulus. The large
      PRP effect found initially (353 ms in Session 1) shrank to only about 40
      ms over the course of practice, disappearing entirely for 1 of the 6
      participants. This reduction in the PRP effect with practice is
      considerably larger than has been previously reported. The obtained
      pattern of factor interactions between stimulus onset asynchrony and each
      of three task difficulty manipulations (Task 1 judgment difficulty, Task 2
      stimulus contrast, and Task 2 mapping compatibility) supports a
      postponement (bottleneck) account of dual-task interference, both before
      and after practice.

AB  - M. A. Van Selst, E. Ruthruff, and J. C. Johnston (1999) found that
      practice dramatically reduced dual-task interference in a Psychological
      Refractory Period (PRP) paradigm with 1 vocal response and 1 manual
      response. Results from 3 further experiments using the highly trained
      participants of M. A. Van Selst et al. (1999) support 4 main conclusions:
      (a) A processing bottleneck exists even after extensive practice; (b) the
      principal cause of the reduction in PRP interference with practice is
      shortening of Task 1 bottleneck stages; (c) a secondary cause is that 1 or
      more, but not all, of the Task 2 substages that are postponed before
      practice are not postponed after practice (i.e., become automatized); and
      (d) the extent of PRP reduction with practice depends on the modalities of
      the 2 responses. A control experiment with 2 manual response tasks showed
      less PRP reduction with practice than that found by Van Selst et al.

AB  - When Ss perform 750 trials of a speeded choice task mapping different
      categories of symbols (e.g., letters, digits) onto different responses,
      excellent transfer is observed to new items in trained categories (Exp 1).
      However, when arbitrary sets of stimuli are mapped onto each response,
      introducing new stimuli substantially retards performance (Exp 2), even
      when the size of the potential stimulus set remains constant (Exp 3).
      Responses to already trained items are as slow as responses to new items
      in these transfer tests. When the mapping is categorical, shuffling the
      assignment of stimuli to responses drastically slows responses (Exp 4).
      However, changing to a spatially homologous mapping with responses on the
      other hand produces excellent transfer (Exp 5). Together, results indicate
      that practice in speeded choice tasks affects primarily the
      response-selection stage. Data suggest that practice primarily strengthens
      links between category representations and spatially defined responses.
      When an arbitrary collection of symbols is mapped onto a given response,
      practice produces an ad hoc category representation and strengthens links
      between individual items and the category and links between the category
      and the response. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights

AB  - The authors examined whether the learning and performance of dual tasks by
      young and old adults could be enhanced through training. Adults were
      trained with either a fixed-priority or variable-priority training
      strategy on a monitoring task and an alphabet-arithmetic task and then
      transferred to a scheduling and a paired-associates running memory task.
      Participants in the variable priority condition learned the monitoring and
      alphabet-arithmetic tasks more quickly and achieved a higher level of
      mastery on these tasks than did those in the fixed-priority condition.
      Moreover, participants trained with the variable priority technique showed
      evidence of the development of automatic processing and a more rapid rate
      of learning and higher level of mastery of the transfer tasks than did the
      fixed-priority participants. These results are discussed in terms of the
      mechanisms that underlie learning and performance of dual tasks and with
      respect to potential applications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA,

AB  - We examined the relation of action video game practice and the
      optimization of executive control skills that are needed to coordinate two
      different tasks. As action video games are similar to real life situations
      and complex in nature, and include numerous concurrent actions, they may
      generate an ideal environment for practicing these skills (Green &
      Bavelier, 2008). For two types of experimental paradigms, dual-task and
      task switching respectively; we obtained performance advantages for
      experienced video gamers compared to non-gamers in situations in which two
      different tasks were processed simultaneously or sequentially. This
      advantage was absent in single-task situations. These findings indicate
      optimized executive control skills in video gamers. Similar findings in
      non-gamers after 15 h of action video game practice when compared to
      non-gamers with practice on a puzzle game clarified the causal relation
      between video game practice and the optimization of executive control
      skills.

AB  - This study examines whether an improved intertask coordination skill is
      acquired during extensive dual-task training and whether it can be
      transferred to a new dual-task situation. Participants practised a
      visual-manual task and an auditory-vocal task. These tasks were trained in
      two groups matched in dual-task performance measures before practice: a
      single-task practice group and a hybrid practice group (including
      single-task and dual-task practice). After practice, the single-task
      practice group was transferred to the same dual-task situation as that for
      the hybrid practice group (Experiment 1), both groups were transferred to
      a dual-task situation with a new visual task (Experiment 2), and both
      groups were transferred to a dual-task situation with a new auditory task
      matched in task difficulty (Experiment 3). The results show a dual-task
      performance advantage in the hybrid practice group over the single-task
      practice group in the practised dual-task situation (Experiment 1), the
      manipulated visual-task situation (Experiment 2), and the manipulated
      auditory-task situation (Experiment 3). In all experiments, the dual-task
      performance advantage was consistently found for the auditory task only.
      These findings suggest that extended dual-task practice improves the skill
      to coordinate two tasks, which may be defined as an accelerated switching
      operation between both tasks. This skill is relatively robust against
      changes of the component visual and auditory tasks. We discuss how the
      finding of task coordination could be integrated in present models of
      dual-task research.

AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that dual-task performance in situations
      with two simultaneously presented tasks can be substantially improved with
      extensive practice. This improvement was related to the acquisition of
      task coordination skills. Earlier studies provided evidence that these
      skills result from hybrid practice, including dual and single tasks, but
      not from single-task practice. It is an open question, however, whether
      task coordination skills are independent from the specific practice
      situation and are transferable to new situations or whether they are
      non-transferable and task-specific. The present study, therefore, tested
      skill transfer in (1) a dual-task situation with identical tasks in
      practice and transfer, (2) a dual-task situation with two tasks changed
      from practice to transfer, and (3) a task switching situation with two
      sequentially presented tasks. Our findings are largely consistent with the
      assumption that task coordination skills are non-transferable and
      task-specific. We cannot, however, definitively reject the assumption of
      transferable skills when measuring error rates in the dual-task situation
      with two changed tasks after practice. In the task switching situation,
      single-task and hybrid practice both led to a transfer effect on mixing
      costs.

AB  - J. A. Gray (1981, 1982) holds that 2 general motivational systems underlie
      behavior and affect: a behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and a behavioral
      activation system (BAS). Self-report scales to assess dispositional BIS
      and BAS sensitivities were created. Scale development (Study 1) and
      convergent and discriminant validity in the form of correlations with
      alternative measures are reported (Study 2). In Study 3, a situation in
      which Ss anticipated a punishment was created. Controlling for initial
      nervousness, Ss high in BIS sensitivity (assessed earlier) were more
      nervous than those low in BIS sensitivity. In Study 4, a situation in
      which Ss anticipated a reward was created. Controlling for initial
      happiness, Ss high in BAS sensitivity (Reward Responsiveness and Drive
      scales) were happier than those low in BAS sensitivity. In each case the
      new scales predicted better than an alternative measure. Discussion is
      focused on conceptual implications. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016

AB  - When natural scenes are viewed, a multitude of objects that are stable in
      their environments are brought in and out of view by eye movements. The
      posterior parietal cortex is crucial for the analysis of space, visual
      attention and movement. Neurons in one of its subdivisions, the lateral
      intraparietal area (LIP), have visual responses to stimuli appearing
      abruptly at particular retinal locations (their receptive fields). We have
      tested the responses of LIP neurons to stimuli that entered their
      receptive field by saccades. Neurons had little or no response to stimuli
      brought into their receptive field by saccades, unless the stimuli were
      behaviourally significant. We established behavioural significance in two
      ways: either by making a stable stimulus task-relevant, or by taking
      advantage of the attentional attraction of an abruptly appearing stimulus.
      Our results show that under ordinary circumstances the entire visual world
      is only weakly represented in LIP. The visual representation in LIP is
      sparse, with only the most salient or behaviourally relevant objects being
      strongly represented.

AB  - Although we may not realize it, our brain function varies markedly from
      moment to moment such that our brain responses exhibit substantial
      variability across trials even in response to a simple repeating stimulus.
      Should we care about such within-subject variability? Are there
      developmental, cognitive, and clinical consequences to having a brain that
      is more or less variable/noisy? Although neural variability seems to be
      beneficial for learning, excessive levels of neural variability are
      apparent in individuals with different clinical disorders. We propose that
      measuring distinct types of neural variability in autism and other
      disorders is likely to reveal crucial insights regarding their
      neuropathology. We further discuss the importance of studying neural
      variability more generally across development and aging in humans.

AB  - Intra-individual variability reflects a transient, within-person change in
      behavioral performance. It is a common component of aging-related
      cognitive decline and the behavioral changes associated with
      neurodegenerative and other brain-related disorders such as traumatic
      brain injury and schizophrenia. Behavioral changes within an individual
      can reflect alterations at a systems or a cellular level in the brain, and
      monitoring intra-individual variability can therefore provide a warning of
      underlying pathology. Despite frequent reports of intra-individual
      variability, there is little synthesis, and no direct examination of the
      neural underpinnings. Here, we integrate seminal findings from cognitive
      research across lifespans of individuals, and also neuropsychological and
      neurobiological findings, to identify key questions and some potential
      answers, and to set challenges for fostering future research into
      intra-individual variability.

AB  - The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the
      familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we
      point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance
      testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of
      falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is
      equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller
      otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery
      rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a
      gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to
      control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a
      simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of
      the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated
      with examples.

AB  - Research on attention is concerned with selective processing of incoming
      sensory information. To some extent, our awareness of the world depends on
      what we choose to attend, not merely on the stimulation entering our
      senses. British psychologists have made substantial contributions to this
      topic in the past century. Celebrated examples include Donald Broadbent's
      filter theory of attention, which set the agenda for most subsequent work;
      and Anne Treisman's revisions of this account, and her later
      feature-integration theory. More recent contributions include Alan
      Allport's prescient emphasis on the relevance of neuroscience data, and
      John Duncan's integration of such data with psychological theory. An
      idiosyncratic but roughly chronological review of developments is
      presented, some practical and clinical implications are briefly sketched,
      and future directions suggested. One of the biggest changes in the field
      has been the increasing interplay between psychology and neuroscience,
      which promises much for the future. A related change has been the
      realization that selection attention is best thought of as a broad topic,
      encompassing a range of selective issues, rather than as a single
      explanatory process.

AB  - The effects of spatial or featural attention on the activity of neurons
      have been studied in many experiments that have used a variety of
      neurophysiological approaches. Other experiments have examined how
      expectations about reward are represented in neuronal activity in various
      brain regions. Although attention and reward are distinct concepts, I
      argue here that many neurophysiological experiments on attention and
      reward do not permit a clean dissociation between the two. This problem
      arises in part because reward contingencies are the only parameter
      manipulated in any of these experiments. I describe how attention and
      reward expectations have been confounded, giving rise to uncertainty about
      how signals related to attention and reward are distributed in the brain.

TI  - Attention and Associative Learning in Humans: An Integrative Review
T2  - Psychol. Bull.
PY  - 2016
DA  - 2016/8/8
AB  - This article presents a comprehensive survey of research concerning
      interactions between associative learning and attention in humans. Four
      main findings are described. First, attention is biased toward stimuli
      that predict their consequences reliably (). This finding is consistent
      with the approach taken by Mackintosh (1975) in his attentional model of
      associative learning in nonhuman animals. Second, the strength of this
      attentional bias is modulated by the value of the outcome (). That is,
      predictors of high-value outcomes receive especially high levels of
      attention. Third, the related but opposing idea that may result in
      increased attention to stimuli (Pearce & Hall, 1980), receives less
      support. This suggests that hybrid models of associative learning,
      incorporating the mechanisms of both the Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall
      theories, may not be required to explain data from human participants.
      Rather, a simpler model, in which attention to stimuli is determined by
      how strongly they are associated with significant outcomes, goes a long
      way to account for the data on human attentional learning. The last main
      finding, and an exciting area for future research and theorizing, is that
      and modulate both deliberate attentional focus, and more automatic
      attentional capture. The automatic influence of learning on attention does
      not appear to fit the traditional view of attention as being either or .
      Rather, it suggests a new kind of "derived" attention. (PsycINFO Database

AB  - Total contralateral hemianopia follows unilateral removal of the entire
      occipito-temporal neocortex in the cat. This deficit is classically
      ascribed to interruption of visual radiations serving cortical function
      ("cortical blindness") and is considered permanent. Return of vision to
      the hemianopic field after subsequent removal of the superior colliculus
      contralateral to the cortical lesion demonstrates that neither assumption
      is correct. The initial hemianopia is apparently due to depression of
      function of the colliculus ipsilateral to the cortical lesion, a de-
      pression maintained by influx of inhibition from the crossed colliculus.
      Thus, removal of the contralateral tectum, or splitting of the collicular
      commissure, abolishes this inhibition and allows the return of function in
      the ipsilateral colliculus, and with it the recovery fronm hemianopia.
      These findings emphasize that visually guided behavior is mediated at both
      cortical and midbrain levels, and that there is a marked interaction
      between these sites.

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has proved to be useful for
      analyzing the effects of illness and pharmacological agents on brain
      activation. Many fMRI studies now incorporate effective connectivity
      analyses on data to assess the networks recruited during task performance.
      The assessment of the sample size that is necessary for carrying out such
      calculations would be useful if these techniques are to be confidently
      applied. Here, we present a method of estimating the sample size that is
      required for a study to have sufficient power. Our approach uses Bayesian
      Model Selection to find a best fitting model and then uses a bootstrapping
      technique to provide an estimate of the parameter variance. As
      illustrative examples, we apply this technique to two different tasks and
      show that for our data, ~20 volunteers per group is sufficient. Due to
      variability between task, volunteers, scanner, and acquisition parameters,
      this would need to be evaluated on individual datasets. This approach will
      be a useful guide for Dynamic Causal Modeling studies.

      Ss were examined regarding the accurate observation of some detailed
      features of words on printed pages. The Ss had to mark every word
      containing 2 letters 'e' and 's', until considerable improvement in speed
      and accuracy was attained. Accuracy was measured by the number of
      omissions, and by the proportion of the words marked, to those which
      should have been marked. For the trained Ss, a comparison of tests before
      and after training was made. Improvement in the function of observing and
      marking words containing the 2 alphabets was not equivalent to improvement
      in the group function of observing the make-up of words. Neither speed nor
      accuracy acquired in the training were equally applicable to other data.

      number of experiments were conducted on 6 Ss, who were tested on judgments
      of variations of size, weight and area. Results show that there was no
      inner necessity for improvement of one function, to improve others closely
      similar to it, due to a transfer of practice effect. In estimations of
      magnitudes in terms of unfamiliar standards, the acquisition of the new
      concept affected the judgment. Training might have also given ideas of how
      to most successfully estimate habits of making judgments in better ways.
      These habits might concern features in which the function trained and
      functions tested were identical. For similar functions and favorable cases
      for getting better standards and better habits of judging, the amount of
      improvement got by training in an allied function is small. (PsycINFO

AB  - Decision theory proposes that humans and animals decide what to do in a
      given situation by assessing the relative value of each possible response.
      This assessment can be computed, in part, from the probability that each
      action will result in a gain and the magnitude of the gain expected. Here
      we show that the gain (or reward) a monkey can expect to realize from an
      eye-movement response modulates the activity of neurons in the lateral
      intraparietal area, an area of primate cortex that is thought to transform
      visual signals into eye-movement commands. We also show that the activity
      of these neurons is sensitive to the probability that a particular
      response will result in a gain. When animals can choose freely between two
      alternative responses, the choices subjects make and neuronal activation
      in this area are both correlated with the relative amount of gain that the
      animal can expect from each response. Our data indicate that a
      decision-theoretic model may provide a powerful new framework for studying
      the neural processes that intervene between sensation and action.

AB  - Learning to associate the probability and value of behavioral outcomes
      with specific stimuli (value learning) is essential for rational decision
      making. However, in demanding cognitive conditions, access to learned
      values might be constrained by limited attentional capacity. We measured
      recognition of briefly presented faces seen previously in a value-learning
      task involving monetary wins and losses; the recognition task was
      performed both with and without constraints on available attention.
      Regardless of available attention, recognition was substantially enhanced
      for motivationally salient stimuli (i.e., stimuli highly predictive of
      outcomes), compared with equally familiar stimuli that had weak or no
      motivational salience, and this effect was found regardless of valence
      (win or loss). However, when attention was constrained (because stimuli
      were presented during an attentional blink, AB), valence determined
      recognition; win-associated faces showed no AB, but all other faces showed
      large ABs. Motivationa...

AB  - Jonides (1980, p. 111) suggested a model to account for shifts of spatial
      attention in visual search tasks with less than 100% cue validity. This
      two-stage probability matching model was subsequently tested by Jonides
      (1983). Reaction time distribution characteristics indeed provided some
      support for the model. In the present paper the relevant data presented in
      Jonides (1980, 1981, 1983) are further analysed. The results of this
      analysis strongly support the probability matching hypothesis. Probability
      matching is apparently a very important strategic characteristic of visual
      spatial attention that deserves much more study.

AB  - Abstract The analytical methods of information theory are applied to the
      data obtained in certain choice-reaction-time experiments. Two types of
      experiment were performed: (a) a conventional choice-reaction experiment,
      with various numbers of alternatives up to ten, and with a negligible
      proportion of errors, and (b) a ten-choice experiment in which the
      subjects deliberately reduced their reaction time by allowing themselves
      various proportions of errors. The principal finding is that the rate of
      gain of information is, on the average, constant with respect to time,
      within the duration of one perceptual-motor act, and has a value of the
      order of five “bits” per second. The distribution of reaction times among
      the ten stimuli in the second experiment is shown to be related to the
      objective uncertainty as to which response will be given to each stimulus.
      The distribution of reaction times among the responses is also related to
      the same uncertainty. This is further evidence that information is
      intimately concerned with reaction time. Some possible conceptual models
      of the process are considered, but tests against the data are
      inconclusive.

AB  - The salience map is a crucial concept for many theories of visual
      attention. On this map, each object in the scene competes for selection -
      the more conspicuous the object, the greater its representation, and the
      more likely it will be chosen. In recent years, the firing patterns of
      single neurons have been interpreted using this framework. Here, we review
      evidence showing that the expression of salience is remarkably similar
      across structures, remarkably different across tasks, and modified in
      important ways when the salient object is consistent with the goals of the
      participant. These observations have important ramifications for theories
      of attention. We conclude that priority--the combined representation of
      salience and relevance--best describes the firing properties of neurons.

AB  - Models of attention and saccade target selection propose that within the
      brain there is a topographic map of visual salience that combines
      bottom-up and top-down influences to identify locations for further
      processing. The results of a series of experiments with monkeys performing
      visual search tasks have identified a population of frontal eye field
      (FEF) visually responsive neurons that exhibit all of the characteristics
      of a visual salience map. The activity of these FEF neurons is not
      sensitive to specific features of visual stimuli; but instead, their
      activity evolves over time to select the target of the search array. This
      selective activation reflects both the bottom-up intrinsic conspicuousness
      of the stimuli and the top-down knowledge and goals of the viewer. The
      peak response within FEF specifies the target for the overt gaze shift.
      However, the selective activity in FEF is not in itself a motor command
      because the magnitude of activation reflects the relative behavioral
      significance of the different stimuli in the visual scene and occurs even
      when no saccade is made. Identifying a visual salience map in FEF
      validates the theoretical concept of a salience map in many models of
      attention. In addition, it strengthens the emerging view that FEF is not
      only involved in producing overt gaze shifts, but is also important for
      directing covert spatial attention.

AB  - This article presents a comprehensive survey of research concerning
      interactions between associative learning and attention in humans. Four
      main findings are described. First, attention is biased toward stimuli
      that predict their consequences reliably (learned predictiveness). This
      finding is consistent with the approach taken by Mackintosh (1975) in his
      attentional model of associative learning in nonhuman animals. Second, the
      strength of this attentional bias is modulated by the value of the outcome
      (learned value). That is, predictors of high-value outcomes receive
      especially high levels of attention. Third, the related but opposing idea
      that uncertainty may result in increased attention to stimuli (Pearce &
      Hall, 1980), receives less support. This suggests that hybrid models of
      associative learning, incorporating the mechanisms of both the Mackintosh
      and Pearce-Hall theories, may not be required to explain data from human
      participants. Rather, a simpler model, in which attention to stimuli is
      determined by how strongly they are associated with significant outcomes,
      goes a long way to account for the data on human attentional learning. The
      last main finding, and an exciting area for future research and
      theorizing, is that learned predictiveness and learned value modulate both
      deliberate attentional focus, and more automatic attentional capture. The
      automatic influence of learning on attention does not appear to fit the
      traditional view of attention as being either goal-directed or
      stimulus-driven. Rather, it suggests a new kind of “derived” attention.

AB  - Orienting of spatial attention is a family of phylogenetically old
      mechanisms developed to select information for further processing.
      Information can be selected via top-down or endogenous mechanisms,
      depending on the goals of the observers or on the task at hand. Moreover,
      salient and potentially dangerous events also attract spatial attention
      via bottom-up or exogenous mechanisms, allowing a rapid and efficient
      reaction to unexpected but important events. Fronto-parietal brain
      networks have been demonstrated to play an important role in supporting
      spatial attentional orienting, although there is no consensus on whether
      there is a single attentional system supporting both endogenous and
      exogenous attention, or two anatomical and functionally different
      attentional systems. In the present paper we review behavioral evidence
      emphasizing the differential characteristics of both systems, as well as
      their possible interactions for the control of the final orienting
      response. Behavioral studies reporting qualitative differences between the
      effects of both systems as well as double dissociations of the effects of
      endogenous and exogenous attention on information processing, suggest that
      they constitute two independent attentional systems, rather than a single
      one. Recent models of attentional orienting in humans have put forward the
      hypothesis of a dorsal fronto-parietal network for orienting spatial
      attention, and a more ventral fronto-parietal network for detecting
      unexpected but behaviorally relevant events. Non-invasive neurostimulation
      techniques, as well as neuropsychological data, suggest that endogenous
      and exogenous attention are implemented in overlapping, although partially
      segregated, brain circuits. Although more research is needed in order to
      refine our anatomical and functional knowledge of the brain circuits
      underlying spatial attention, we conclude that endogenous and exogenous
      spatial orienting constitute two independent attentional systems, with
      different behavioral effects, and partially distinct neural substrates.

AB  - We are quite often exposed to multiple objects present in the visual
      scene, thus attentional selection is necessary in order to selectively
      respond to the relevant information. Objects can be selected on the basis
      of the location they occupy by orienting attention in space. In this
      paper, we review the evidence showing that attention can be oriented in
      space either endogenously, on the basis of central cues, predictive of the
      relevant location, or exogenously, automatically triggered by the salient
      properties of visual stimuli (peripheral cues). Several dissociations
      observed between orienting on the basis of the two types of cues have led
      to the conclusion that they do not represent just two modes of triggering
      the orienting of the very same attentional mechanism, but rather they
      modulate processing differently. We present a theoretical framework
      according to which endogenous predictive cues facilitate target processing
      by orienting attention, thus amplifying processing at the attended
      location. In contrast, apart from attentional orienting, peripherally
      presented discrepant cues might trigger additional cue-target
      event-integration and event-segregation processes, which modulate
      processing in a different way, thus leading to cueing effects that are
      exclusively triggered by peripheral cues.

AB  - Can we build endogenous expectations about the locus of occurrence of a
      target without being able to describe them? Participants performed
      cue-target detection tasks with different proportions of valid and invalid
      trials, without being informed of these proportions, and demonstrated
      typical endogenous effects. About half were subsequently able to correctly
      describe the cue-target relationships ('verbalizers'). However, even
      non-verbalizer participants showed endogenous orienting with peripheral
      cues (Experiments 1 and 3), not depending solely on practice (Experiment
      2). Explicit instructions did not bring about dramatic advantages in
      performance (Experiment 4). With central symbolic cues, only verbalizers
      showed reliable endogenous effects (Experiment 5). We concluded that
      endogenous orienting with peripheral cues can occur independently of
      participants developing explicit hypotheses about the cue-target
      relationships.

AB  - Phenomenological models of decision-making, including the drift-diffusion
      and race models, are compared with mechanistic, biologically plausible
      models, such as integrate-and-fire attractor neuronal network models. The
      attractor network models show how decision confidence is an emergent
      property; and make testable predictions about the neural processes
      (including neuronal activity and fMRI signals) involved in decision-making
      which indicate that the medial prefrontal cortex is involved in reward
      value-based decision-making. Synaptic facilitation in these models can
      help to account for sequential vibrotactile decision-making, and for how
      postponed decision-related responses are made. The randomness in the
      neuronal spiking-related noise that makes the decision-making
      probabilistic is shown to be increased by the graded firing rate
      representations found in the brain, to be decreased by the diluted
      connectivity, and still to be significant in biologically large networks
      with thousands of synapses onto each neuron. The stability of these
      systems is shown to be influenced in different ways by glutamatergic and
      GABAergic efficacy, leading to a new field of dynamical neuropsychiatry
      with applications to understanding schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive
      disorder. The noise in these systems is shown to be advantageous, and to
      apply to similar attractor networks involved in short-term memory,
      long-term memory, attention, and associative thought processes.

AB  - We propose a system of interconnected modules consisting of populations of
      neurons for modelling the underlying mechanisms involved in selective
      visual attention. We demonstrate that it is plausible to build a neural
      system for visual search, which works across the visual field in parallel,
      but, due to the intrinsic dynamics of the system, resembles apparent modes
      of visual attention, namely the serial focal and the parallel spread over
      the space mode. Thus, neither explicit serial focal search nor saliency
      maps need to be assumed. A focal attentional spotlight is not included in
      the system but rather focal attention emerges due to the convergence of
      the dynamic behaviour of the neural networks. The dynamics of the system
      can be interpreted as a mechanism for routing information from the sensory
      input.

AB  - Attention provides the gateway to cognition, by selecting certain stimuli
      for further analysis. Recent research demonstrates that whether a stimulus
      captures attention is not determined solely by its physical properties,
      but is malleable, being influenced by our previous experience of rewards
      obtained by attending to that stimulus. Here we show that this influence
      of reward learning on attention extends to task-irrelevant stimuli. In a
      visual search task, certain stimuli signaled the magnitude of available
      reward, but reward delivery was not contingent on responding to those
      stimuli. Indeed, any attentional capture by these critical distractor
      stimuli led to a reduction in the reward obtained. Nevertheless,
      distractors signaling large reward produced greater attentional and
      oculomotor capture than those signaling small reward. This
      counterproductive capture by task-irrelevant stimuli is important because
      it demonstrates how external reward structures can produce patterns of
      behavior that conflict with task demands, and similar processes may
      underlie problematic behavior directed toward real-world rewards.

AB  - Cognitive behaviour requires complex context-dependent mapping between
      sensory stimuli and actions. The same stimulus can lead to different
      behaviours depending on the situation, or the same behaviour may be
      elicited by different cueing stimuli. Neurons in the primate prefrontal
      cortex show task-specific firing activity during working memory delay
      periods. These neurons provide a neural substrate for mapping stimulus and
      response in a flexible, context- or rule-dependent, fashion. We describe
      here an integrate-and-fire network model to explain and investigate the
      different types of working-memory-related neuronal activity observed. The
      model contains different populations (or pools) of neurons (as found
      neurophysiologically) in attractor networks which respond in the delay
      period to the stimulus object, the stimulus position ('sensory pools'), to
      combinations of the stimulus sensory properties (e.g. the object identity
      or object location) and the response ('intermediate pools'), and to the
      response required (left or right) ('premotor pools'). The pools are
      arranged hierarchically, are linked by associative synaptic connections,
      and have global inhibition through inhibitory interneurons to implement
      competition. It is shown that a biasing attentional input to define the
      current rule applied to the intermediate pools enables the system to
      select the correct response in what is a biased competition model of
      attention. The integrate-and-fire model not only produces realistic
      spiking dynamicals very similar to the neuronal data but also shows how
      dopamine could weaken and shorten the persistent neuronal activity in the
      delay period; and allows us to predict more response errors when dopamine
      is elevated because there is less different activity in the different
      pools of competing neurons, resulting in more conflict.

AB  - Visual neglect occurs most frequently and persistently after lesions that
      include the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), a part of the inferior
      parietal lobule. Patients with this syndrome make very few saccades to the
      left, and show abnormal performance on tasks in which they must covertly
      shift their attention to the left, suggesting that the right SMG is
      involved in the generation of saccades and attention shifts. Functional
      imaging studies of saccades and covert attention shifts in the normal
      brain, however, have shown weak or absent responses in both SMGs. We used
      event-related functional MRI to re-examine the responses to saccades and
      attention shifts within a single experiment, and to assess responses to
      left- and right-sided stimuli independently. When subjects made saccades
      to peripheral stimuli, the expected responses were seen in striate and
      prestriate cortex, the superior parietal lobules, the frontal eye fields,
      the supplementary motor area and the anterior insulae. In addition there
      was a response in the right SMG but not in the left SMG, as predicted from
      the clinical literature. When subjects made a covert visual assessment of
      the peripheral stimulus without any saccade, greater activity was seen in
      all of the areas in the frontoparietal network. Each area showed a bias
      towards contralateral stimuli, with two exceptions: the anterior insulae
      gave mainly ipsilateral responses, whilst the right SMG gave equal
      responses to right- and left-sided stimuli. These findings are discussed
      in the context of current theories pertaining to the clinical syndrome of
      neglect.

AB  - It has recently been demonstrated that a cortical network of visuospatial
      and oculomotor control areas is active for covert shifts of spatial
      attention (shifts of attention without eye movements) as well as for overt
      shifts of spatial attention (shifts of attention with saccadic eye
      movements). Studies examining activity in this visuospatial network during
      attentional shifts at a single rate have given conflicting reports about
      how the activity differs for overt and covert shifts. To better understand
      how the network subserves attentional shifts, we performed a parametric
      study in which subjects made either overt attentional shifts or covert
      attentional shifts at three different rates (0.2, 1.0, and 2.0 Hz). At
      every shift rate, both overt and covert shifts of visuospatial attention
      induced activations in the precentral sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, and
      lateral occipital cortex that were of greater amplitude for overt than
      during covert shifting. As the rate of attentional shifts increased,
      responses in the visuospatial network increased in both overt and covert
      conditions but this parametric increase was greater during overt shifts.
      These results confirm that overt and covert attentional shifts are
      subserved by the same network of areas. Overt shifts of attention elicit
      more neural activity than do covert shifts, reflecting additional activity
      associated with saccade execution. An additional finding concerns the
      anatomical organization of the visuospatial network. Two distinct
      activation foci were observed within the precentral sulcus for both overt
      and covert attentional shifts, corresponding to specific anatomical
      landmarks. We therefore reappraise the correspondence of these two
      precentral areas with the frontal eye fields.

AB  - We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the
      functional anatomical relationship between covert orienting of visual
      spatial attention and execution of saccadic eye movements. Brain areas
      engaged by shifting spatial attention covertly and by moving the eyes
      repetitively toward visual targets were compared and contrasted directly
      within the same subjects. The two tasks activated highly overlapping
      neural systems and showed that common parietal and frontal regions are
      more activated during the covert task than the overt oculomotor condition.
      The possible nature of the relationship between these two operations is
      discussed.

AB  - To study the mechanisms underlying covert orienting of attention in visual
      space, subjects were given advance cues indicating the probable locations
      of targets that they had to discriminate and localize. Direct peripheral
      cues (brightening of one of four boxes in peripheral vision) and symbolic
      central cues (an arrow at the fixation point indicating a probable
      peripheral box) were compared. Peripheral and central cues are believed to
      activate different reflexive and voluntary modes of orienting (Jonides,
      1981; Posner, 1980). Experiment 1 showed that the time courses of
      facilitation and inhibition from peripheral and central cues were
      characteristic and different. Experiment 2 showed that voluntary orienting
      in response to symbolic central cues is interrupted by reflexive orienting
      to random peripheral flashes. Experiment 3 showed that irrelevant
      peripheral flashes also compete with relevant peripheral cues. The amount
      of interference varied systematically with the interval between the onset
      of the relevant cue and of the distracting flash (cue-flash onset
      asynchrony) and with the cuing condition. Taken together, these effects
      support a model for spatial attention with distinct but interacting
      reflexive and voluntary orienting mechanisms.

AB  - Reinforcement learning, one of the most active research areas in
      artificial intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby
      an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives when
      interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In Reinforcement
      Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple
      account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their
      discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations
      to the most recent developments and applications. The only necessary
      mathematical background is familiarity with elementary concepts of
      probability. The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the
      reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part
      II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo
      methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified
      view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks,
      eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case
      studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning.

PB  - The MIT Press
AB  - Introduces and illustrates the additive-factor method (AFM) for
      discovering the parts of a mental process. This method uses data from
      reaction time (RT) measurements in special kinds of experiments. The
      author notes that they are special in being factorial experiments, in
      which 2 or more factors (experimental variables) are manipulated in such a
      way that how their effects combine can be determined. It is argued that
      the AFM has the virtues of being applicable to a variety of problems, and
      requiring relatively few theoretical assumptions. It is noted that the
      method is limited to discovering modules that are arranged in series, as a
      sequence of stages. The examples discussed in the present chapter range
      over naming a digit, retrieving information from memory, searching a
      visual display, switching between tasks, comparing disoriented objects,
      producing speech, deciding whether a letter string is a word in English,
      and others. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Theories of attentional control are divided over whether the capture of
      spatial attention depends primarily on stimulus salience or is contingent
      on attentional control settings induced by task demands. The authors
      addressed this issue using the N2-posterior- contralateral (N2pc) effect,
      a component of the event-related brain potential thought to reflect
      attentional allocation. They presented a cue display followed by a target
      display of 4 letters. Each display contained a green item and a red item.
      Some participants responded to the red letter and others to the green
      letter. Converging lines of evidence indicated that attention was captured
      by the cues with the same color as the target. First, these target-color
      cues produced a cuing validity effect on behavioral measures. Second,
      distractors appearing in the cued location produced larger compatibility
      effects. Third, the target-color cue produced a robust N2pc effect,
      similar in magnitude to the N2pc effect to the target itself. Furthermore,
      the target-color cue elicited a similar N2pc effect regardless of whether
      it competed with a simultaneous abrupt onset. The findings provide
      converging evidence for attentional capture contingent on top-down control
      settings.

AB  - To find out whether attentional capture by irrelevant but salient visual
      objects is an exogenous bottom-up phenomenon, or can be modulated by
      current task set, two experiments were conducted where the N2pc component
      was measured as an electrophysiological marker of attentional selection in
      response to spatially uninformative color singleton cues that preceded
      target arrays. When observers had to report the orientation of a uniquely
      colored target bar among distractor bars (color task), behavioral spatial
      cueing effects were accompanied by an early cue-induced N2pc, indicative
      of rapid attentional capture by color singleton cues. In contrast, when
      they reported the orientation of target bars presented without distractors
      (onset task), no behavioral cueing effects were found and no early N2pc
      was triggered to physically identical cue arrays. Experiment 2 ruled out
      an alternative interpretation of these N2pc differences in terms of
      distractor inhibition. These results do not support previous claims that
      attentional capture is initially unaffected by top-down intention, and
      demonstrate the central role of task set in involuntary attentional
      orienting.

      which different classes of stimulus arrays were designated targets and the
      remaining stimulus arrays were designated nontargets. In Experiments 1 and
      2, both target and nontarget pop-out stimuli elicited an enhanced anterior
      N2 wave and a contralaterally larger posterior P1 wave, but Experiments 3
      and 4 demonstrated that these components do not reflect fully automatic
      pop-out detection processes. In all four experiments, target pop-outs
      elicited enlarged anterior P2, posterior N2, occipital P3, and parietal P3
      waves. The target-elicited posterior N2 wave contained a contralateral
      subcomponent (N2pc) that exhibited a focus over occipital cortex in maps
      of current source density. The overall pattern of results was consistent
      with guided search models in which preattentive stimulus information is
      used to guide attention to task-relevant stimuli.

T2  - Neuroimage

SP  - 171-183
PY  - 2017

AB  - Mechanisms of attention assign priority to sensory inputs on the basis of
      current task goals. Previous studies have shown that lateralized neural
      oscillations within the alpha (8-14Hz) range are associated with the
      voluntary allocation of attention to the contralateral visual field. It is
      currently unknown, however, whether similar oscillatory signatures
      instantiate the involuntary capture of spatial attention by goal-relevant
      stimulus properties. Here we investigated the roles of theta (4-8Hz),
      alpha, and beta (14-30Hz) oscillations in human goal-directed visual
      attention. Across two experiments, we had participants respond to a brief
      target of a particular color among heterogeneously colored distractors.
      Prior to target onset, we cued one location with a lateralized,
      non-predictive cue that was either target- or non-target-colored. During
      the behavioral task, we recorded brain activity using
      electroencephalography (EEG), with the aim of analyzing cue-elicited
      oscillatory activity. We found that theta oscillations lateralized in
      response to all cues, and this lateralization was stronger if the cue
      matched the target color. Alpha oscillations lateralized relatively later,
      and only in response to target-colored cues, consistent with the capture
      of spatial attention. Our findings suggest that stimulus induced changes
      in theta and alpha amplitude reflect task-based modulation of signals by
      feature-based and spatial attention, respectively.

AB  - Search for conjunctions of highly discriminable features can be rapid or
      even parallel. This article explores three possible accounts based on (a)
      perceptual segregation, (b) conjunction detectors, and (c) inhibition
      controlled separately by two or more distractor features. Search rates for
      conjunctions of color, size, orientation, and direction of motion
      correlated closely with an independent measure of perceptual segregation.
      However, they appeared unrelated to the physiology of single-unit
      responses. Each dimension contributed additively to conjunction search
      rates, suggesting that each was checked independently of the others.
      Unknown targets appear to be found only by serial search for each in turn.
      Searching through 4 sets of distractors was slower than searching through
      2. The results suggest a modification of feature integration theory, in
      which attention is controlled not only by a unitary "window" but also by a
      form of feature-based inhibition.

AB  - Perceptual decision making is the act of choosing one option or course of
      action from a set of alternatives on the basis of available sensory
      evidence. Thus, when we make such decisions, sensory information must be
      interpreted and translated into behaviour. Neurophysiological work in
      monkeys performing sensory discriminations, combined with computational
      modelling, has paved the way for neuroimaging studies that are aimed at
      understanding decision-related processes in the human brain. Here we
      review findings from human neuroimaging studies in conjunction with data
      analysis methods that can directly link decisions and signals in the human
      brain on a trial-by-trial basis. This leads to a new view about the neural
      basis of human perceptual decision-making processes.

AB  - To survive in a complex world, it is important that unattended, but
      salient, input can still draw one's attention. In this article, we suggest
      that posterior alpha oscillations (8-13Hz) provide a mechanism for
      prioritizing and ordering unattended visual input according to
      'relevance'. Gamma oscillations (30-100Hz) that are phase-locked to the
      alpha oscillations keep competing unattended representations apart in
      time, thus creating a sequence of perceptual cycles. As inhibition
      gradually lowers within an alpha cycle, the ordered sequence of competing
      input is activated, producing a temporal phase code for saliency. The
      proposed mechanism is based on recent experiments indicating that the
      phase of alpha activity modulates perception and that alpha oscillations
      are produced by periodic pulses of inhibition.

AB  - Predictive coding models of attention propose that attention and
      prediction operate synergistically to optimize perception, as reflected in
      interactive effects on early sensory neural responses. It is yet unclear
      whether attention and prediction based on the temporal attributes of
      expected events operate in a similar fashion. We investigated how
      attention and prediction based on timing interact by manipulating the task
      relevance and a priori probability of auditory stimulus onset timing
      within a go/no-go task while recording EEG. Preparatory activity, as
      indexed via the contingent negative variation, reflected temporally
      specific anticipation as a function of both attention and prediction.
      Higher stimulus probability led to significant predictive N1 suppression;
      however, we failed to find an effect of task relevance on N1 amplitude and
      an interaction of task relevance with prediction. We suggest the
      predictability of sensory timing is the predominant influence on early
      sensory responses where a priori probabilities allow for strong prior
      beliefs. When this is the case, we find that the effects of temporal
      prediction on early sensory responses are independent of the task
      relevance of sensory stimuli. Our findings contribute to the expansion of
      predictive coding frameworks to include the role of timing in sensory
      processing.

AB  - Activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analyses were used to examine
      the neural correlates of prediction error in reinforcement learning. The
      findings are interpreted in the light of current computational models of
      learning and action selection. In this context, particular consideration
      is given to the comparison of activation patterns from studies using
      instrumental and Pavlovian conditioning, and where reinforcement involved
      rewarding or punishing feedback. The striatum was the key brain area
      encoding for prediction error, with activity encompassing dorsal and
      ventral regions for instrumental and Pavlovian reinforcement alike, a
      finding which challenges the functional separation of the striatum into a
      dorsal 'actor' and a ventral 'critic'. Prediction error activity was
      further observed in diverse areas of predominantly anterior cerebral
      cortex including medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex.
      Distinct patterns of prediction error activity were found for studies
      using rewarding and aversive reinforcers; reward prediction errors were
      observed primarily in the striatum while aversive prediction errors were
      found more widely including insula and habenula.

AB  - Positive reinforcement helps to control the acquisition of learned
      behaviours. Here we report a cellular mechanism in the brain that may
      underlie the behavioural effects of positive reinforcement. We used
      intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) as a model of reinforcement
      learning1, in which each rat learns to press a lever that applies
      reinforcing electrical stimulation to its own substantia nigra2, 3. The
      outputs from neurons of the substantia nigra terminate on neurons in the
      striatum in close proximity to inputs from the cerebral cortex on the same
      striatal neurons4. We measured the effect of substantia nigra stimulation
      on these inputs from the cortex to striatal neurons and also on how
      quickly the rats learned to press the lever. We found that stimulation of
      the substantia nigra (with the optimal parameters for lever-pressing
      behaviour) induced potentiation of synapses between the cortex and the
      striatum, which required activation of dopamine receptors. The degree of
      potentiation within ten minutes of the ICSS trains was correlated with the
      time taken by the rats to learn ICSS behaviour. We propose that
      stimulation of the substantia nigra when the lever is pressed induces a
      similar potentiation of cortical inputs to the striatum, positively
      reinforcing the learning of the behaviour by the rats.

      perception, are reviewed. The major emphasis of the review is on reading
      as a specific example of cognitive processing. Basic topics discussed with
      respect to reading are (a) the characteristics of eye movements, (b) the
      perceptual span, (c) integration of information across saccades, (d) eye
      movement control, and (e) individual differences (including dyslexia).
      Similar topics are discussed with respect to the other tasks examined. The
      basic theme of the review is that eye movement data reflect
      moment-to-moment cognitive processes in the various tasks examined.
      Theoretical and practical considerations concerning the use of eye
      movement data are also discussed.

AB  - The classic experiments of Yarbus over 50 years ago revealed that saccadic
      eye movements reflect cognitive processes. But it is only recently that
      three separate advances have greatly expanded our understanding of the
      intricate role of eye movements in cognitive function. The first is the
      demonstration of the pervasive role of the task in guiding where and when
      to fixate. The second has been the recognition of the role of internal
      reward in guiding eye and body movements, revealed especially in
      neurophysiological studies. The third important advance has been the
      theoretical developments in the fields of reinforcement learning and
      graphic simulation. All of these advances are proving crucial for
      understanding how behavioral programs control the selection of visual
      information.

AB  - Humans can show striking capacity limitations in sensorimotor processing.
      Fortunately, these limitations can be attenuated with training. However,
      less fortunately, training benefits often remain limited to trained tasks.
      Recent behavioral observations suggest that the extent to which training
      transfers may depend on the specific stage of information processing that
      is being executed. Training benefits for a task that taps the
      consolidation of sensory information (sensory encoding) transfer to new
      stimulus-response mappings, whereas benefits for selecting an appropriate
      action (decision-making/response selection) remain specific to the trained
      mappings. Therefore, training may have dissociable influences on the
      neural events underlying subsequent sensorimotor processing stages. Here,
      we used EEG to investigate this possibility. In a pretraining baseline
      session, participants completed two four-alternative-choice response time
      tasks, presented both as a single task and as part of a dual task (with
      another task). The training group completed a further 3,000 training
      trials on one of the four-alternative-choice tasks. Hence, one task became
      trained, whereas the other remained untrained. At test, a negative-going
      component that is sensitive to sensory-encoding demands (N2) showed
      increased amplitudes and reduced latencies for trained and untrained
      mappings relative to a no-train control group. In contrast, the onset of
      the stimulus-locked lateralized readiness potential, a component that
      reflects the activation of motor plans, was reduced only for tasks that
      employed trained stimulus-response mappings, relative to untrained
      stimulus-response mappings and controls. Collectively, these results show
      that training benefits are dissociable for the brain events that reflect
      distinct sensorimotor processing stages.

AB  - Practice or training on a particular task often yields gains for the
      trained task; however, the extent to which these benefits generalize to
      other stimuli/tasks is contentious. It has been suggested that behavioral
      decision-making/response selection training may enhance temporal visual
      attention, as measured using the attentional blink (AB) paradigm. Here, we
      show that AB can indeed be reduced through response selection training,
      which requires repeatedly performing a speeded decision-making task.
      Training gains garnered by this approach transferred to distinct AB
      measures, but not to unrelated measures of visual search and multitasking
      ability. Moreover, these changes were still evident 2 weeks after training
      completion. Crucially, training on 2 active control tasks-visual search
      and motion discrimination-did not elicit similar gains. Such malleability
      of temporal visual attention via response selection training offers
      tantalizing prospects for future cognitive enhancement endeavors.

VL  - 76

AB  - A growing body of research suggests that dual-task interference in sensory
      consolidation (e.g., the attentional blink, AB) and response selection
      (e.g., the psychological refractory period, PRP) stems from a common
      central bottleneck of information processing. With regard to response
      selection, it is well known that training reduces dual-task interference.
      We tested whether training that is known to be effective for response
      selection can also reduce dual-task interference in sensory consolidation.
      Over two experiments, performance on a PRP paradigm (Exp. 1) and on AB
      paradigms (differing in their stimuli and task demands, Exps. 1 and 2) was
      examined after participants had completed a relevant training regimen (T1
      practice for both paradigms), an irrelevant training regimen (comparable
      sensorimotor training, not related to T1 for both tasks), a visual-search
      training regimen (Exp. 2 only), or after participants had been allocated
      to a no-training control group. Training that had shown to be effective
      for reducing dual-task interference in response selection was also found
      to be effective for reducing interference in sensory consolidation. In
      addition, we found some evidence that training benefits transferred to the
      sensory consolidation of untrained stimuli. Collectively, these findings
      show that training benefits can transfer across cognitive operations that
      draw on the central bottleneck in information processing. These findings
      have implications for theories of the AB and for the design of
      cognitive-training regimens that aim to produce transferable training
      benefits.

AB  - Spatial asymmetries are an intriguing feature of directed attention.
      Recent observations indicate an influence of temperament upon the
      direction of these asymmetries. It is unknown whether this influence
      generalises to visual orienting behaviour. The aim of the current study
      was therefore to explore the relationship between temperament and measures
      of spatial orienting as a function of target hemifield. An exogenous
      cueing task was administered to 92 healthy participants. Temperament was
      assessed using Carver and White's (1994) Behavioural Inhibition System and
      Behavioural Activation System (BIS/BAS) scales. Individuals with high
      sensitivity to punishment and low sensitivity to reward showed a leftward
      asymmetry of directed attention when there was no informative spatial cue
      provided. This asymmetry was not present when targets were preceded by
      spatial cues that were either valid or invalid. The findings support the
      notion that individual variations in temperament influence spatial
      asymmetries in visual orienting, but only when lateral targets are
      preceded by a non-directional (neutral) cue. The results are discussed in
      terms of hemispheric asymmetries and dopamine activity.

AB  - Although the involvement in the striatum in the refinement and control of
      motor movement has long been recognized, recent description of discrete
      frontal corticobasal ganglia networks in a range of species has focused
      attention on the role particularly of the dorsal striatum in executive
      functions. Current evidence suggests that the dorsal striatum contributes
      directly to decision-making, especially to action selection and
      initiation, through the integration of sensorimotor, cognitive, and
      motivational/emotional information within specific corticostriatal
      circuits involving discrete regions of striatum. We review key evidence
      from recent studies in rodent, nonhuman primate, and human subjects.

AB  - We describe a model of visual processing in which feedback connections
      from a higher- to a lower-order visual cortical area carry predictions of
      lower-level neural activities, whereas the feedforward connections carry
      the residual errors between the predictions and the actual lower-level
      activities. When exposed to natural images, a hierarchical network of
      model neurons implementing such a model developed simple-cell-like
      receptive fields. A subset of neurons responsible for carrying the
      residual errors showed endstopping and other extra-classical
      receptive-field effects. These results suggest that rather than being
      exclusively feedforward phenomena, nonclassical surround effects in the
      visual cortex may also result from cortico-cortical feedback as a
      consequence of the visual system using an efficient hierarchical strategy
      for encoding natural images.

AB  - Attentional mechanisms are important for selecting relevant information
      and filtering out irrelevant information from cluttered visual scenes.
      Selective attention has previously been shown to affect neural activity in
      both extrastriate and striate visual cortex. Here, evidence from
      functional brain imaging shows that attentional response modulation is not
      confined to cortical processing, but can occur as early as the thalamic
      level. We found that attention modulated neural activity in the human
      lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in several ways: it enhanced neural
      responses to attended stimuli, attenuated responses to ignored stimuli and
      increased baseline activity in the absence of visual stimulation. The LGN,
      traditionally viewed as the gateway to visual cortex, may also serve as a
      'gatekeeper' in controlling attentional response gain.

PB  - OUP Oxford
AB  - The Neuropsychology of Anxiety first appeared in 1982, quickly
      establishing itself as a classic work in the psychology and neuroscience
      literature. It presented an innovative, and at times controversial, theory
      of anxiety and the brain systems, especially the septo-hippocampal system,
      that subserve it. It rapidly established itself as an important new work
      in the field. This Second Edition is a significant departure from the
      first, drawing upon extensive reviews of data from the ethology of
      defence, learning theory, the psychopharmacology of anti-anxiety drugs,
      anxiety disorders, and clinical and laboratory analysis of amnesia. The
      cognitive and behavioural functions in anxiety of the septo-hippocampal
      system and the amygdala are extensively analysed, as are their separate
      roles in memory and fear. Their functions are related to a hierarchy of
      additional structures that control other forms of defensive behaviour. The
      resulting theory is applied to the typology, symptoms, and therapy of
      anxiety and phobic disorders, and to the symptoms of amnesia. Available
      for the first time in paperback, this new edition will be a valuable
      reference text for researchers and graduate students in psychology,
      clinical psychology, psychiatry, psychopharmacology, neuroscience, and
      neurology.

AB  - A broad range of neural and behavioral data suggests that the brain
      contains multiple systems for behavioral choice, including one associated
      with prefrontal cortex and another with dorsolateral striatum. However,
      such a surfeit of control raises an additional choice problem: how to
      arbitrate between the systems when they disagree. Here, we consider
      dual-action choice systems from a normative perspective, using the
      computational theory of reinforcement learning. We identify a key
      trade-off pitting computational simplicity against the flexible and
      statistically efficient use of experience. The trade-off is realized in a
      competition between the dorsolateral striatal and prefrontal systems. We
      suggest a Bayesian principle of arbitration between them according to
      uncertainty, so each controller is deployed when it should be most
      accurate. This provides a unifying account of a wealth of experimental
      evidence about the factors favoring dominance by either system.

      systems which incorporate a central switching mechanism. We propose that
      the vertebrate basal ganglia have evolved as a centralized selection
      device, specialized to resolve conflicts over access to limited motor and
      cognitive resources. Analysis of basal ganglia functional architecture and
      its position within a wider anatomical framework suggests it can satisfy
      many of the requirements expected of an efficient selection mechanism.

AB  - This study presents the first direct investigation of the hypothesis that
      dopamine depletion of the dorsal striatum in mild Parkinson disease leads
      to impaired stimulus-response habit formation, thereby rendering behavior
      slow and effortful. However, using an instrumental conflict task, we show
      that patients are able to rely on direct stimulus-response associations
      when a goal-directed strategy causes response conflict, suggesting that
      habit formation is not impaired. If anything our results suggest a disease
      severity-dependent deficit in goal-directed behavior. These results are
      discussed in the context of Parkinson disease and the neurobiology of
      habitual and goal-directed behavior.

TI  - Endogenous orienting in the archer fish
T2  - Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.
PY  - 2017
DA  - 2017/7/3
AB  - The literature has long emphasized the neocortex's role in volitional
      processes. In this work, we examined endogenous orienting in an
      evolutionarily older species, the archer fish, which lacks neocortex-like
      cells. We used Posner's classic endogenous cuing task, in which a
      centrally presented, spatially informative cue is followed by a target.
      The fish responded to the target by shooting a stream of water at it.
      Interestingly, the fish demonstrated a human-like "volitional"
      facilitation effect: their reaction times to targets that appeared on the
      side indicated by the precue were faster than their reaction times to
      targets on the opposite side. The fish also exhibited inhibition of
      return, an aftermath of orienting that commonly emerges only in reflexive
      orienting tasks in human participants. We believe that this pattern
      demonstrates the acquisition of an arbitrary connection between spatial
      orienting and a nonspatial feature of a centrally presented stimulus in
      nonprimate species. In the literature on human attention, orienting in
      response to such contingencies has been strongly associated with
      volitional control. We discuss the implications of these results for the
      evolution of orienting, and for the study of volitional processes in all
      species, including humans.

AB  - Twenty years ago, striatal cholinergic neurons were central figures in
      models of basal ganglia function. But since then, they have receded in
      importance. Recent studies are likely to lead to their re-emergence in our
      thinking. Cholinergic interneurons have been implicated as key players in
      the induction of synaptic plasticity and motor learning, as well as in
      motor dysfunction. In Parkinson's disease and dystonia, diminished
      striatal dopaminergic signalling leads to increased release of
      acetylcholine by interneurons, distorting network function and inducing
      structural changes that undoubtedly contribute to the symptoms. By
      contrast, in Huntington's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy,
      there is a fall in striatal cholinergic markers. This review gives an
      overview of these recent experimental and clinical studies, placing them
      within the context of the pathogenesis of movement disorders.

AB  - What role does reward play in real-world human vision? Reward coding in
      the midbrain is thought to cause the rapid prioritization of
      reward-associated visual stimuli. However, existing evidence for this
      incentive salience hypothesis in vision is equivocal, particularly in
      naturalistic circumstances, and little is known about underlying neural
      systems. Here we use human fMRI to test whether reward primes perceptual
      encoding of naturalistic visual stimuli and to identify the neural
      mechanisms underlying this function. Participants detected a cued object
      category in briefly presented images of city- and landscapes. Using
      multivoxel pattern analysis in visual cortex, we found that the encoding
      of reward-associated targets was enhanced, whereas encoding of
      reward-associated distractors was suppressed, with the strength of this
      effect predicted by activity in the dopaminergic midbrain and a connected
      cortical network. These results identify a novel interaction between
      neural systems responsible for reward processing and visual perception in
      the human brain.

AB  - Sensory systems must rely on powerful mechanisms for organizing complex
      information. We propose a framework in which inhibitory alpha oscillations
      limit and prioritize neuronal processing. At oscillatory peaks, inhibition
      prevents neuronal firing. As the inhibition ramps down within a cycle, a
      set of neuronal representations will activate sequentially according to
      their respective excitability. Both top-down and bottom-up drives
      determine excitability; in particular, spatial attention is a major
      top-down influence. On a shorter time scale, fast recurrent inhibition
      segments representations in slots 10-30 ms apart, generating gamma-band
      activity at the population level. The proposed mechanism serves to convert
      spatially distributed representations in early visual regions to a
      temporal phase code: that is, 'to-do lists' that can be processed
      sequentially by downstream regions.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a dynamic causal model (DCM) of steady-state
      responses in electrophysiological data that are summarised in terms of
      their cross-spectral density. These spectral data-features are generated
      by a biologically plausible, neural-mass model of coupled electromagnetic
      sources; where each source comprises three sub-populations. Under
      linearity and stationarity assumptions, the model's biophysical parameters
      (e.g., post-synaptic receptor density and time constants) prescribe the
      cross-spectral density of responses measured directly (e.g., local field
      potentials) or indirectly through some lead-field (e.g.,
      electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic data). Inversion of
      the ensuing DCM provides conditional probabilities on the synaptic
      parameters of intrinsic and extrinsic connections in the underlying
      neuronal network. This means we can make inferences about synaptic
      physiology, as well as changes induced by pharmacological or behavioural
      manipulations, using the cross-spectral density of invasive or
      non-invasive electrophysiological recordings. In this paper, we focus on
      the form of the model, its inversion and validation using synthetic and
      real data. We conclude with an illustrative application to multi-channel
      local field potential data acquired during a learning experiment in mice.

AB  - Functional integration in the brain rests on anatomical connectivity (the
      presence of axonal connections) and effective connectivity (the causal
      influences mediated by these connections). The deployment of anatomical
      connections provides important constraints on effective connectivity, but
      does not fully determine it, because synaptic connections can be expressed
      functionally in a dynamic and context-dependent fashion. Although it is
      generally assumed that anatomical connectivity data is important to guide
      the construction of neurobiologically realistic models of effective
      connectivity; the degree to which these models actually profit from
      anatomical constraints has not yet been formally investigated. Here, we
      use diffusion weighted imaging and probabilistic tractography to specify
      anatomically informed priors for dynamic causal models (DCMs) of fMRI
      data. We constructed 64 alternative DCMs, which embodied different
      mappings between the probability of an anatomical connection and the prior
      variance of the corresponding of effective connectivity, and fitted them
      to empirical fMRI data from 12 healthy subjects. Using Bayesian model
      selection, we show that the best model is one in which anatomical
      probability increases the prior variance of effective connectivity
      parameters in a nonlinear and monotonic (sigmoidal) fashion. This means
      that the higher the likelihood that a given connection exists
      anatomically, the larger one should set the prior variance of the
      corresponding coupling parameter; hence making it easier for the parameter
      to deviate from zero and represent a strong effective connection. To our
      knowledge, this study provides the first formal evidence that
      probabilistic knowledge of anatomical connectivity can improve models of
      functional integration.

AB  - Both theoretical and experimental animal work supports the hypothesis that
      transient oscillatory synchronization of neuronal assemblies at gamma
      frequencies (30-100 Hz) is closely associated with sensory processing.
      Recent data from recordings in animals and humans have suggested that
      gamma-frequency activity also has an important role in attention and both
      working and long-term memory. The involvement of gamma-band
      synchronization in various cognitive paradigms in humans is currently
      being investigated using intracranial and high-density electro- and
      magnetoencephalography recordings. Here, we discuss recent findings
      demonstrating human gamma-frequency activity associated with attention and
      memory in both sensory and non-sensory areas. Because oscillatory
      gamma-frequency activity has an important role in neuronal communication
      and synaptic plasticity, it could provide a key for understanding neuronal
      processing in both local and distributed cortical networks engaged in
      complex cognitive functions. This review is part of the INMED/TINS special
      issue Physiogenic and pathogenic oscillations: the beauty and the beast,
      based on presentations at the annual INMED/TINS symposium

AB  - Despite the wealth of research on face perception, the interactions
      between core regions in the face-sensitive network of the visual cortex
      are not well understood. In particular, the link between neural activity
      in face-sensitive brain regions measured by fMRI and EEG markers of
      face-selective processing in the N170 component is not well established.
      In this study, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) as a data fusion
      approach to integrate concurrently acquired EEG and fMRI data during the
      perception of upright compared with inverted faces. Data features derived
      from single-trial EEG variability were used as contextual modulators on
      fMRI-derived estimates of effective connectivity between key regions of
      the face perception network. The overall construction of our model space
      was highly constrained by the effects of task and ERP parameters on our
      fMRI data. Bayesian model selection suggested that the occipital face area
      (OFA) acted as a central gatekeeper directing visual information to the
      superior temporal sulcus (STS), the fusiform face area (FFA), and to a
      medial region of the fusiform gyrus (mFG). The connection from the OFA to
      the STS was strengthened on trials in which N170 amplitudes to upright
      faces were large. In contrast, the connection from the OFA to the mFG, an
      area known to be involved in object processing, was enhanced for inverted
      faces particularly on trials in which N170 amplitudes were small. Our
      results suggest that trial-by-trial variation in neural activity at around
      170 ms, reflected in the N170 component, reflects the relative engagement
      of the OFA to STS/FFA network over the OFA to mFG object processing
      network for face perception. Importantly, the DCMs predicted the observed
      data significantly better by including the modulators derived from the
      N170, highlighting the value of incorporating EEG-derived information to
      explain interactions between regions as a multi-modal data fusion method
      for combined EEG-fMRI.

AB  - During simple sensorimotor decision making, neurons in the parietal cortex
      extract evidence from sensory information provided by visual areas until a
      decision is reached. Contextual information can bias parietal activity
      during the task and change the decision-making parameters. One type of
      contextual information is the availability of reward for correct
      decisions. We tested the hypothesis that the frontal lobes and basal
      ganglia use contextual information to bias decision making to maximize
      reward. Human volunteers underwent functional MRI while making decisions
      about the motion of dots on a computer monitor. On rewarded trials,
      subjects responded more slowly by increasing the threshold to decision.
      Rewarded trials were associated with activation in the ventral striatum
      and prefrontal cortex in the period preceding coherent dot motion, and the
      degree of activation predicted the increased decision threshold.
      Decreasing dopamine transmission, using a tyrosine-depleting amino acid
      mixture, abolished the reward-related corticostriatal activation and
      eliminated the correlation between striatal activity and decision
      threshold. These observations provide direct evidence that some
      reward-related functional MRI signals in the striatum are the result of
      dopamine neuron activity and demonstrate that mesolimbic dopamine
      transmission can influence perceptual and decision-making neural processes
      engaged to maximize reward harvest.

AB  - The frontal lobes are important for cognitive control, yet their
      functional organization remains controversial. An influential class of
      theory proposes that the frontal lobes are organized along their
      rostrocaudal axis to support hierarchical cognitive control. Here, we take
      an updated look at the literature on hierarchical control, with particular
      focus on the functional organization of lateral frontal cortex. Our review
      of the evidence supports neither a unitary model of lateral frontal
      function nor a unidimensional abstraction gradient. Rather, separate
      frontal networks interact via local and global hierarchical structure to
      support diverse task demands.

AB  - The human cognitive system is severely limited in the amount of
      information it can process simultaneously. When two tasks are presented
      within a short stimulus-onset-asynchrony (SOA), reaction time of each
      task, especially task 2, is dramatically delayed. Previous studies have
      shown that such delay is accompanied by increased activation in the right
      inferior frontal gyrus (GFi). In this study, we address the role of right
      GFi in resolving dual-task interference at two different stages:
      allocation of perceptual attention and response selection. We scan 12
      subjects using functional MRI while they conduct two tasks-shape
      discrimination in task 1 and color discrimination in task 2-and vary the
      SOA between tasks as 100 or 1500 ms. The targets are located at the center
      or at the periphery. When both are at the center, they compete primarily
      for response selection. When both are at the periphery, they additionally
      compete for the allocation of perceptual attention. Results show that the
      right GFi and frontal operculum regions are significantly more active in
      the short SOA than the long SOA condition, but only when subjects attend
      to the periphery in both tasks. We conclude that the right lateral frontal
      regions are important for resolving dual-task interference at the
      perceptual attention stage.

AB  - There is no consensus regarding the origin of behavioral interference that
      occurs during concurrent multitasking. Some evidence points toward a
      multitasking locus in the brain, while other results imply that
      interference is the consequence of task interactions in several brain
      regions. To investigate this issue, we conducted a functional MRI (fMRI)
      study consisting of three component tasks, which were performed both
      separately and in combination. The results indicated that no specific
      multitasking area exists. Instead, different patterns of activation across
      conditions could be explained by assuming that the interference is a
      result of task interactions. Additionally, similarity in single-task
      activation patterns correlated with a decrease in accuracy during
      dual-task conditions. Taken together, these results support the view that
      multitasking interference is not due to a bottleneck in a single
      "multitasking" brain region, but is a result of interactions between
      concurrently running processes.

AB  - Human performance exhibits strong multi-tasking limitations in simple
      response time tasks. In the psychological refractory period (PRP)
      paradigm, where two tasks have to be performed in brief succession,
      central processing of the second task is delayed when the two tasks are
      performed at short time intervals. Here, we aimed to probe the cortical
      network underlying this postponement of central processing by
      simultaneously recording electroencephalography (EEG) and functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while 12 subjects performed two
      simple number-comparison tasks. Behavioral data showed a significant
      slowing of response times to the second target stimulus at short
      stimulus-onset asynchronies, together with significant correlations
      between response times to the first and second target stimulus, i.e., the
      hallmarks of the PRP effect. The analysis of EEG data showed a significant
      delay of the post-perceptual P3 component evoked by the second target,
      which was of similar magnitude as the effect on response times. fMRI data
      revealed an involvement of parietal and prefrontal regions in dual-task
      processing. The combined analysis of fMRI and EEG data-based on the
      trial-by-trial variability of the P3-revealed that BOLD signals in two
      bilateral regions in the inferior parietal lobe and precentral gyrus
      significantly covaried with P3 related activity. Our results show that
      combining neuroimaging methods of high spatial and temporal resolutions
      can help to identify cortical regions underlying the central bottleneck of
      information processing, and strengthen the conclusion that fronto-parietal
      cortical regions participate in a distributed "global neuronal workspace"
      system that underlies the generation of the P3 component and may be one of
      the key cerebral underpinnings of the PRP bottleneck.

AB  - The basal ganglia comprise several nuclei in the forebrain, diencephalon,
      and midbrain thought to play a significant role in the control of posture
      and movement. It is well recognized that people with degenerative diseases
      of the basal ganglia suffer from rigidly held abnormal body postures,
      slowing of movement, involuntary movements, or a combination of these a
      abnormalities. However, it has not been agreed just what the basal ganglia
      contribute to normal movement. Recent advances in knowledge of the basal
      ganglia circuitry, activity of basal ganglia neurons during movement, and
      the effect of basal ganglia lesions have led to a new hypothesis of basal
      ganglia function. The hypothesis states that the basal ganglia do not
      generate movements. Instead, when voluntary movement is generated by
      cerebral cortical and cerebellar mechanisms, the basal ganglia act broadly
      to inhibit competing motor mechanisms that would otherwise interfere with
      the desired movement. Simultaneously, inhibition is removed focally from
      the desired motor mechanisms to allow that movement to proceed. Inability
      to inhibit competing motor programs results in slow movements, abnormal
      postures and involuntary muscle activity.

AB  - A new theoretical framework, executive-process interactive control (EPIC),
      is introduced for characterizing human performance of concurrent
      perceptual-motor and cognitive tasks. On the basis of EPIC, computational
      models may be formulated to simulate multiple-task performance under a
      variety of circumstances. These models account well for reaction-time data
      from representative situations such as the psychological refractory-period
      procedure. EPIC's goodness of fit supports several key conclusions: (a) At
      a cognitive level, people can apply distinct sets of production rules
      simultaneously for executing the procedures of multiple tasks; (b)
      people's capacity to process information at "peripheral" perceptual-motor
      levels is limited; (c) to cope with such limits and to satisfy task
      priorities, flexible scheduling strategies are used; and (d) these
      strategies are mediated by executive cognitive processes that coordinate
      concurrent tasks adaptively.

      Meyer (2001) reported that dual-task costs are minimal when participants

      examined whether such findings are compatible with the operation of an
      efficient response selection bottleneck. Participants trained until they
      were able to perform both tasks simultaneously without interference. Novel
      stimulus pairs produced no reaction time costs, arguing against the
      development of compound stimulus-response associations (Experiment 1).
      Manipulating the relative onsets (Experiments 2 and 4) and durations
      (Experiments 3 and 4) of response selection processes did not lead to
      dual-task costs. The results indicate that the 2 tasks did not share a
      bottleneck after practice.

AB  - Memories for habits and skills ("implicit or procedural memory") and
      memories for facts ("explicit or episodic memory") are built up in
      different brain systems and are vulnerable to different neurodegenerative
      disorders in humans. So that the striatum-based mechanisms underlying
      habit formation could be studied, chronic recordings from ensembles of
      striatal neurons were made with multiple tetrodes as rats learned a T-maze
      procedural task. Large and widely distributed changes in the neuronal
      activity patterns occurred in the sensorimotor striatum during behavioral
      acquisition, culminating in task-related activity emphasizing the
      beginning and end of the automatized procedure. The new ensemble patterns
      remained stable during weeks of subsequent performance of the same task.
      These results suggest that the encoding of action in the sensorimotor
      striatum undergoes dynamic reorganization as habit learning proceeds.

AB  - Learning to perform a behavioural procedure as a well-ingrained habit
      requires extensive repetition of the behavioural sequence, and learning
      not to perform such behaviours is notoriously difficult. Yet regaining a
      habit can occur quickly, with even one or a few exposures to cues
      previously triggering the behaviour. To identify neural mechanisms that
      might underlie such learning dynamics, we made long-term recordings from
      multiple neurons in the sensorimotor striatum, a basal ganglia structure
      implicated in habit formation, in rats successively trained on a
      reward-based procedural task, given extinction training and then given
      reacquisition training. The spike activity of striatal output neurons,
      nodal points in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, changed markedly across
      multiple dimensions during each of these phases of learning. First, new
      patterns of task-related ensemble firing successively formed, reversed and
      then re-emerged. Second, task-irrelevant firing was suppressed, then
      rebounded, and then was suppressed again. These changing spike activity
      patterns were highly correlated with changes in behavioural performance.
      We propose that these changes in task representation in cortico-basal
      ganglia circuits represent neural equivalents of the explore-exploit
      behaviour characteristic of habit learning.

AB  - Performance on two different task combinations was examined for evidence
      that timesharing skills are learned with practice and can transfer between
      task combinations. One combination consisted of two discrete informaion
      processing tasks, a short-term memory task and a classification task; the
      other consisted of two identical one-dimensional compensatory tracking
      tasks. Three groups of 16 subjects were employed in the experiment. The
      first received dual-task training on both combinations; the second
      received single-task training on the discrete-task combination and
      dual-task training on the tracking combination; the third received
      dual-task training on the tracking combination only. Evidence for distinct
      timesharing skills was found in both combinations using a new technique
      designed to separate improvements in timesharing skills from improvements
      in single-task performance. Transfer of timesharing skills also was found.
      Several fine-grained analyses performed on the data from the discrete task
      combination and a Control Theory Analysis of the tracking data indicated
      that skills in parallel processing were learned in each combination and
      transferred between them.

AB  - Doing two things at once is difficult. When two tasks have to be performed
      within a short interval, the second is sharply delayed, an effect called
      the Psychological Refractory Period (PRP). Similarly, when two successive
      visual targets are briefly flashed, people may fail to detect the second
      target (Attentional Blink or AB). Although AB and PRP are typically
      studied in very different paradigms, a recent detailed neuromimetic model
      suggests that both might arise from the same serial stage during which
      stimuli gain access to consciousness and, as a result, can be arbitrarily
      routed to any other appropriate processor. Here, in agreement with this
      model, we demonstrate that AB and PRP can be obtained on alternate trials
      of the same cross-modal paradigm and result from limitations in the same
      brain mechanisms. We asked participants to respond as fast as possible to
      an auditory target T1 and then to a visual target T2 embedded in a series
      of distractors, while brain activity was recorded with
      magneto-encephalography (MEG). For identical stimuli, we observed a
      mixture of blinked trials, where T2 was entirely missed, and PRP trials,
      where T2 processing was delayed. MEG recordings showed that PRP and
      blinked trials underwent identical sensory processing in visual
      occipito-temporal cortices, even including the non-conscious separation of
      targets from distractors. However, late activations in frontal cortex
      (>350 ms), strongly influenced by the speed of task-1 execution, were
      delayed in PRP trials and absent in blinked trials. Our findings suggest
      that PRP and AB arise from similar cortical stages, can occur with the
      same exact stimuli, and are merely distinguished by trial-by-trial
      fluctuations in task processing.

AB  - There is often strong interference if a second target stimulus (T2) is
      presented before processing of a prior target stimulus (T1) is complete.
      In the "Psychological Refractory Period" (PRP) paradigm, responses are
      speeded and interference manifests as increased response time for T2. In
      the "Attentional Blink" (AB) paradigm, stimuli are masked and responses
      unspeeded; interference manifests as reduced T2 accuracy. While different
      causes have usually been considered for PRP and AB phenomena, recent
      evidence has supported a unified account based on a single, shared
      restriction on concurrent processing. Here we show that a full assessment
      of separate and shared resource limitations requires direct comparison of
      hybrid PRP/AB trials with corresponding pure PRP and AB cases. Randomizing
      trial types in such a comparison also brings substantial benefit in
      addressing possible changes in task preparation or readiness. The data
      from two such experiments--combining speeded auditory (SA) and unspeeded
      visual (UV) task events--provide clear evidence for both separate and
      shared resource limitations. Often interference is strongest for T1 and T2
      events of the same type, reflecting predominantly different limitations in
      SA and UV processing. With modest increases in demand, however,
      interference between different event types can also be made arbitrarily
      large, reflecting arbitrarily important shared limitations. For even such
      simple tasks as these, T--T2 interference reflects a combination of
      relatively local and relatively global sources.

AB  - It has been proposed that task control is functionally implemented by a
      distributed frontoparietal system. It has been argued that one component
      of this system, the lateral frontal cortex, is functionally organized
      through a caudal to rostral gradient. Here, we tested 2 competing models,
      the Information Cascade and Rule Abstraction hypotheses, which suggest
      different principles underlying the rostrocaudal gradient. We presented
      participants with 4 vertical lines on a screen and asked them to indicate
      the position of the shortest line. We manipulated the difficulty of the
      task in 3 simple ways: By increasing the number of lines, by decreasing
      the difference between short and normal line length, and by changing the
      stimulus-response mapping. As expected, these manipulations evoked
      widespread frontoparietal activation, with activity much more anterior
      than predicted by Information Cascade and Rule Abstraction models. There
      were also striking individual differences in the rostrocaudal extent of
      activity. The results suggest an integrated frontoparietal system, which
      can be recruited as a whole even by very simple task demands.

AB  - Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is arguably the most widely
      used approach to hypothesis evaluation among behavioral and social
      scientists. It is also very controversial. A major concern expressed by
      critics is that such testing is misunderstood by many of those who use it.
      Several other objections to its use have also been raised. In this article
      the author reviews and comments on the claimed misunderstandings as well
      as on other criticisms of the approach, and he notes arguments that have
      been advanced in support of NHST. Alternatives and supplements to NHST are
      considered, as are several related recommendations regarding the
      interpretation of experimental data. The concluding opinion is that NHST
      is easily misunderstood and misused but that when applied with good
      judgment it can be an effective aid to the interpretation of experimental
      data.

AB  - Although humans show a remarkable ability to make rapid and accurate
      decisions in novel situations, it is surprisingly difficult to observe
      transferable benefits when training decision-making performance. The
      current study investigated whether 2 properties of decision-making—amodal
      processing and encoding of abstract relationships—could be leveraged to
      produce transferable training gains, compared with the performance of an
      active-control group. Experiment 1 showed that training responses to
      visually presented stimuli (letters) did not transfer to benefit
      performance for the same stimuli presented in the auditory modality.
      Therefore, training exercises the integration of modality-specific
      information, not a supramodal category. However, Experiment 2 showed that
      when stimuli share an abstract rule, training transfers to new materials
      that conform to the same modality and rule, and to analogous rules in a
      new modality. Therefore, transfer of training benefits requires an
      abstract code that can be generalized to new stimulus sets. (PsycINFO

      important information from scenes, can be deployed to locations in space
      or to spatially invariant object representations. Studies have examined
      both the modulatory effects of attention on the strength of extrastriate
      cortical representations, and the control of attention by parietal and
      frontal cortical circuits. Subregions of parietal and frontal cortex are
      transiently active when attention is voluntarily shifted between spatial
      locations or object representations. This transient activity may reflect
      an abrupt shift in the attentional set of the observer, complementing
      sustained signals that are thought to maintain a given attentive state.

AB  - The identification of targets in visual search arrays may be improved by
      suppressing competing information from the surrounding distractor items.
      The present study provided evidence that this hypothetical filtering
      process has a neural correlate, the "N2pc" component of the event-related
      potential waveform. The N2pc was observed when a target item was
      surrounded by competing distractor items but was absent when the array
      could be rejected as a nontarget on the basis of simple feature
      information. In addition, the N2pc was eliminated when filtering was
      discouraged by removing the distractor items, making the distractors
      relevant, or making all items within an array identical. Combined with
      previous topographic analyses, these results suggest that attentional
      filtering occurs in occipital cortex under the control of feedback from
      higher cortical regions after a preliminary feature-based analysis of the
      stimulus array.

AB  - When the visual system must process multiple objects simultaneously, as in
      the visual search paradigm, the neural coding of individual objects can
      become ambiguous due to the visual system's extensive use of coarse coding
      and distributed representations. Here we propose that the primary role of
      visual selective attention within the ventral object recognition pathway
      is to resolve these ambiguities. We begin by reviewing previous studies of
      the effects of attention on neural responses in monkeys, which provide the
      basis for this hypothesis, and then describe a new set of experiments
      showing that similar attentional mechanisms operate in the human brain. In
      these new experiments, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from
      normal human observers while they performed tasks analogous to those used
      previously in monkeys. The central finding was that an attention-related
      ERP wave called the "N2pc component" was present under the same conditions
      that led to attentional modulations of neural responses in monkey visual
      cortex. These human electrophysiological results provide a bridge between
      cognitive-level theories of visual attention and the behavior of
      individual neurons in visual cortex.

AB  - Single cells were recorded in the visual cortex of monkeys trained to
      attend to stimuli at one location in the visual field and ignore stimuli
      at another. When both locations were within the receptive field of a cell
      in prestriate area V4 or the inferior temporal cortex, the response to the
      unattended stimulus was dramatically reduced. Cells in the striate cortex
      were unaffected by attention. The filtering of irrelevant information from
      the receptive fields of extrastriate neurons may underlie the ability to
      identify and remember the properties of a particular object out of the
      many that may be represented on the retina.

AB  - Visual spatial resolution is limited by factors ranging from optics to
      neuronal filters in the visual cortex, but it is not known to what extent
      it is also limited by the resolving power of attention. To investigate
      this, we studied adaptation to lines of specific orientation, a process
      that occurs in primary visual cortex. When a single grating is presented
      in the periphery of the visual field, human observers are aware of its
      orientation, but when it is flanked by other similar gratings
      ('crowding'), its orientation becomes impossible to discern. Nevertheless,
      we show that orientation-specific adaptation is not affected by crowding,
      implying that spatial resolution is limited by an attentional filter
      acting beyond the primary visual cortex. Consistent with this, we find
      that attentional resolution is greater in the lower than in the upper
      visual field, whereas there is no corresponding asymmetry in the primary
      visual cortex. We suggest that the attentional filter acts in one or more
      higher visual cortical areas to restrict the availability of visual
      information to conscious awareness.

SP  - 900-917
PY  - 2019

AB  - Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) EEG activity has been linked to visual attention
      since the earliest EEG studies. More recent studies using spatial cuing
      paradigms have shown that alpha is suppressed over the hemisphere
      contralateral to a to-be-attended location, suggesting that alpha serves
      as a mechanism of preparatory attention. Here, we demonstrate that alpha
      also plays a role in active target processing. EEG activity was recorded
      from a group of healthy male and female human subjects in two visual
      search experiments. In addition to alpha activity, we also assessed the
      N2pc event-related potential component, a lateralized transient EEG
      response that has been tightly linked with the focusing of attention on
      visual targets. We found that the visual search targets triggered both an
      N2pc component and a suppression of alpha-band activity that was greatest
      over the hemisphere contralateral to the target (which we call
      "target-elicited lateralized alpha suppression" or TELAS). In Experiment
      1, both N2pc and TELAS were observed for targets presented in the lower
      visual field but were absent for upper-field targets. However, these two
      lateralized effects had different time courses and they responded
      differently to manipulations of crowding in Experiment 2. These results
      indicate that lateralized alpha-band activity is involved in active target
      processing and is not solely a preparatory mechanism and also that TELAS
      and N2pc reflect a related but separable neural mechanism of visuospatial
      attention.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The very first EEG studies demonstrated
      that alpha-band (8-12 Hz) EEG oscillations are suppressed when people
      attend to visual information and more recent research has shown that cuing
      an individual to expect a target at a specific location produces
      lateralized suppression in the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore,
      lateralized alpha may serve as a preparatory mechanism. In the present
      study, we found that a similar lateralized alpha effect is triggered by
      the appearance of a visual target even though the location could not be
      anticipated, demonstrating that alpha also serves as an active mechanism
      of target processing. Moreover, we found that alpha lateralization can be
      dissociated from other lateralized measures of target selection,
      indicating that it reflects a distinct mechanism of attention.

      the research was to investigate, through pre- and post-training MRI
      scanning, whether the brain adapts to be able to cope with multitasking.
      Negotiating the information-rich sensory world often requires the
      concurrent management of multiple tasks. Despite this, humans are thought
      to be poor at multitasking due to the processing limitations of
      frontoparietal and subcortical (FP-SC) brain regions. Although training is
      known to improve multitasking performance, it is unknown how the FP-SC
      system functionally changes to support improved multitasking. To address
      this, we characterized the FP-SC changes that predict training outcomes
      using an individual differences approach. Participants (N=100) performed
      single and multiple tasks in pre- and post-training magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) sessions interspersed by either a multitasking or an

AB  - Spatial cueing is thought to indicate the resource limits of visual
      attention because invalidly cued items are reported more slowly and less
      accurately than validly cued items. However, limited resource accounts
      cannot explain certain findings, such as dividing attention without costs,
      or attentional benefits without invalidity costs. The current study
      presents a new account of exogenous cueing, namely the memory encoding
      cost (MEC) theory, which integrates attention and memory encoding to
      explain costs and benefits evoked by a spatial cue. Unlike conventional
      theories that focus on the role of attention in yielding spatial cueing
      effects, the MEC theory argues that some cueing effects are caused by a
      combination of attentional facilitation evoked by the cue, but also the
      cost of encoding the cue into memory. The crucial implication of this
      theory is that limitations in attentional deployment may not necessarily
      be the cause of invalidity costs. MEC generates a number of predictions
      that we test here, providing five convergent lines of evidence that cue
      encoding plays a key role in producing cueing effects. Furthermore, the
      MEC suggests a common mechanism underlying cueing costs and the
      attentional blink, and we simulate the core empirical findings of the
      current study with an existing attentional blink model. The model was able
      to simulate these effects primarily through manipulation of a single
      parameter that corresponds to memory encoding. The MEC theory thus
      simplifies our theoretical understanding of attentional effects by linking
      the attentional blink and some varieties of spatial cueing costs to a
      common mechanism. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights

AB  - An independent variable measures some aspect of a treatment applied to a
      person; a dependent variable measures some aspect of the treatment's
      effect upon the person. Two dependent variables will often covary with
      each other because they are affected by a common independent variable. A
      state trace is a graph which plots the value of one dependent variable as
      a function of another. (Thus, a state trace is a generalization of the
      yes-no receiver-operating-characteristic curve.) By appropriately
      analyzing state traces, it is possible to test theories concerning (a) the
      mechanisms by which independent variables affect dependent variables and

AB  - Independent component analysis (ICA) can find distinct sources of
      electroencephalographic (EEG) activity, both brain-based and artifactual,
      and has become a common pre-preprocessing step in analysis of EEG data.
      Distinction between brain and non-brain independent components (ICs)
      accounting for, e.g., eye or muscle activities is an important step in the
      analysis. Here we present a fully automated method to identify
      eye-movement related EEG components by analyzing the spatial distribution
      of their scalp projections (scalp maps). The EyeCatch method compares each
      input scalp map to a database of eye-related IC scalp maps obtained by
      data-mining over half a million IC scalp maps obtained from 80,006 EEG
      datasets associated with a diverse set of EEG studies and paradigms. To
      our knowledge this is the largest sample of IC scalp maps that has ever
      been analyzed. Our result show comparable performance to a previous
      state-of-art semi-automated method, CORRMAP, while eliminating the need
      for human intervention.

AB  - Navigating through our perceptual environment requires constant selection
      of behaviorally relevant information and irrelevant information. Spatial
      cues guide attention to information in the environment that is relevant to
      the current task. How does the amount of information provided by a
      location cue and irrelevant information influence the deployment of
      attention and what are the processes underlying this effect? To address
      these questions, we used a spatial cueing paradigm to measure the
      relationship between cue predictability (measured in bits of information)
      and the voluntary attention effect, the benefit in reaction time (RT)
      because of cueing a target. We found a linear relationship between cue
      predictability and the attention effect. To analyze the cognitive
      processes producing this effect, we used a simple RT model, the Linear
      Ballistic Accumulator model. We found that informative cues reduced the
      amount of evidence necessary to make a response (the threshold),
      regardless of the presence of irrelevant information (i.e., distractors).
      However, a change in the rate of evidence accumulation occurred when
      distractors were present in the display. Thus, the mechanisms underlying
      the deployment of attention are exquisitely tuned to the amount and
      behavioral relevancy of statistical information in the environment.

AB  - To predict where subjects look under natural viewing conditions,
      biologically inspired saliency models decompose visual input into a set of
      feature maps across spatial scales. The output of these feature maps are
      summed to yield the final saliency map. We studied the integration of
      bottom-up feature maps across multiple spatial scales by using eye
      movement data from four recent eye tracking datasets. We use AdaBoost as
      the central computational module that takes into account feature
      selection, thresholding, weight assignment, and integration in a
      principled and nonlinear learning framework. By combining the output of
      feature maps via a series of nonlinear classifiers, the new model
      consistently predicts eye movements better than any of its competitors.

AB  - Many studies have found that stimuli can be discriminated more accurately
      at attended locations than at unattended locations, and such results have
      typically been taken as evidence for the hypothesis that attention
      operates by allocating limited perceptual processing resources to attended
      locations. An alternative proposal, however, is that attention acts to
      reduce uncertainty about target location, thereby increasing accuracy by
      decreasing the number of noise sources. To distinguish between these
      alternatives, we conducted 6 spatial cuing experiments in which target
      location uncertainty was eliminated. Despite the absence of uncertainty,
      target discriminations were more accurate at the attended location,
      consistent with resource allocation models. These cue validity effects
      were observed under a broad range of conditions, including central and
      peripheral cuing, but were absent at very short cue-target delay
      intervals.

AB  - In multivariate pattern analysis of neuroimaging data, 'second-level'
      inference is often performed by entering classification accuracies into a
      t-test vs chance level across subjects. We argue that while the
      random-effects analysis implemented by the t-test does provide population
      inference if applied to activation differences, it fails to do so in the
      case of classification accuracy or other 'information-like' measures,
      because the true value of such measures can never be below chance level.
      This constraint changes the meaning of the population-level null
      hypothesis being tested, which becomes equivalent to the global null
      hypothesis that there is no effect in any subject in the population.
      Consequently, rejecting it only allows to infer that there are some
      subjects in which there is an information effect, but not that it
      generalizes, rendering it effectively equivalent to fixed-effects
      analysis. This statement is supported by theoretical arguments as well as
      simulations. We review possible alternative approaches to population
      inference for information-based imaging, converging on the idea that it
      should not target the mean, but the prevalence of the effect in the
      population. One method to do so, 'permutation-based information prevalence
      inference using the minimum statistic', is described in detail and applied
      to empirical data.

      and globus pallidus internus (GPi). We particularly focused on the rare
      non-target (distractor) stimuli processing. ERPs and ERD/S in the alpha
      and beta frequency range were analyzed in seven Parkinson's disease
      patients and one primary dystonia patient with implanted deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) electrodes. A visual three-stimulus protocol was used
      (frequent stimulus, target stimulus, and distractor). The non-target and
      distractor-related waveforms manifested similar shapes. A specific
      positive ERP peak around 200 ms and a low alpha frequency ERS were
      detected from the STN as a response to the distractor stimuli in six of
      the patients with Parkinson's disease and also in the primary dystonia
      patient's GPi. This positivity probably reflects an attentional orienting
      response to the distractor stimuli. The STN and GPi are probably involved
      in attentional cerebral networks.

AB  - Working memory (WM) is a cognitive system that strongly relates to a
      person's ability to reason with novel information and direct attention to
      goal-relevant information. Due to the central role that WM plays in
      general cognition, it has become the focus of a rapidly growing training
      literature that seeks to affect broad cognitive change through prolonged
      training on WM tasks. Recent work has suggested that the effects of WM
      training extend to general fluid intelligence, attentional control, and
      reductions in symptoms of ADHD. We present a theoretically motivated
      perspective of WM and subsequently review the WM training literature in
      light of several concerns. These include (a) the tendency for researchers
      to define change to abilities using single tasks, (b) inconsistent use of
      valid WM tasks, (c) no-contact control groups, and (d) subjective
      measurement of change. The literature review highlights several findings
      that warrant further research but ultimately concludes that there is a
      need to directly demonstrate that WM capacity increases in response to
      training. Specifically, we argue that transfer of training to WM must be
      demonstrated using a wider variety of tasks, thus eliminating the
      possibility that results can be explained by task specific learning.
      Additionally, we express concern that many of the most promising results
      (e.g., increased intelligence) cannot be readily attributed to changes in
      WM capacity. Thus, a critical goal for future research is to uncover the
      mechanisms that lead to transfer of training.

AB  - A theory of executive control is presented that proposes that executive
      processes control subordinate processes by manipulating their parameters,
      reconfiguring them to respond in accord with the current task set. It
      adopts C. Bundesen's (1990) theory of visual attention (TVA) and R. M.
      Nosofsky and T. J. Palmeri's (1997) exemplar-based random walk (EBRW) as
      the theory of subordinate processes. It assumes that a task set is a set
      of TVA and EBRW parameters sufficient to perform a task and that set
      switching involves changing those parameters. The theory solves 2
      computational problems that emerge in dual-task situations: the binding
      problem and the serial order problem. It can perform dual tasks in series
      or in parallel but prefers the serial strategy because it is faster and it
      solves the binding problem naturally. The theory accounts for concurrence
      cost, set-switching cost, crosstalk between tasks, and the modulation of
      crosstalk by task set.

AB  - Recent neurophysiological experiments have led to a promising "biased
      competition hypothesis" of the neural basis of attention. According to
      this hypothesis, attention appears as a sometimes nonlinear property that
      results from a top-down biasing effect that influences the competitive and
      cooperative interactions that work both within cortical areas and between
      cortical areas. In this paper we describe a detailed dynamical analysis of
      the synaptic and neuronal spiking mechanisms underlying biased
      competition. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamical capabilities
      of the system by exploring the stationary attractors in the parameter
      space by a mean-field reduction consistent with the underlying synaptic
      and spiking dynamics. The nonstationary dynamical behavior, as measured in
      neuronal recording experiments, is studied by an integrate-and-fire model
      with realistic dynamics. This elucidates the role of cooperation and
      competition in the dynamics of biased competition and shows why feedback
      connections between cortical areas need optimally to be weaker by a factor
      of about 2.5 than the feedforward connections in an attentional network.
      We modeled the interaction between top-down attention and bottom-up
      stimulus contrast effects found neurophysiologically and showed that
      top-down attentional effects can be explained by external attention inputs
      biasing neurons to move to different parts of their nonlinear activation
      functions. Further, it is shown that, although NMDA nonlinear effects may
      be useful in attention, they are not necessary, with nonlinear effects
      (which may appear multiplicative) being produced in the way just
      described.

AB  - The brain has a limited capacity and therefore needs mechanisms to
      selectively enhance the information most relevant to one's current
      behavior. We refer to these mechanisms as "attention." Attention acts by
      increasing the strength of selected neural representations and
      preferentially routing them through the brain's large-scale network. This
      is a critical component of cognition and therefore has been a central
      topic in cognitive neuroscience. Here we review a diverse literature that
      has studied attention at the level of behavior, networks, circuits, and
      neurons. We then integrate these disparate results into a unified theory
      of attention.

AB  - We review evidence for partially segregated networks of brain areas that
      carry out different attentional functions. One system, which includes
      parts of the intraparietal cortex and superior frontal cortex, is involved
      in preparing and applying goal-directed (top-down) selection for stimuli
      and responses. This system is also modulated by the detection of stimuli.
      The other system, which includes the temporoparietal cortex and inferior
      frontal cortex, and is largely lateralized to the right hemisphere, is not
      involved in top-down selection. Instead, this system is specialized for
      the detection of behaviourally relevant stimuli, particularly when they
      are salient or unexpected. This ventral frontoparietal network works as a
      'circuit breaker' for the dorsal system, directing attention to salient
      events. Both attentional systems interact during normal vision, and both
      are disrupted in unilateral spatial neglect.

AB  - Review of the literature indicates that, according to theories of
      selective attention, learning about a stimulus depends on attending to
      that stimulus; this is represented in 2-stage models by saying that Ss
      switch in analyzers as well as learning stimulus-response associations. It
      is argued that this assumption, however, is equally well represented in a
      formal model by the incorporation of a stimulus-specific learning-rate
      parameter, a, into the equations describing changes in the associative
      strength of stimuli. Previous theories of selective attention have also
      assumed that (a) Ss learn to attend to and ignore relevant and irrelevant
      stimuli (i.e., that a may increase or decrease depending on the
      correlation of a stimulus with reinforcement); and (b) there is an inverse
      relationship between the probabilities of attending to different stimuli
      (i.e., that an increase in a to one stimulus is accompanied by a decrease
      in a to others). The first assumption has been used to explain the
      phenomena of acquired distinctiveness and dimensional transfer, the second
      to explain those of overshadowing and blocking. It is argued that although
      the first assumption is justified by the data, the second is not:
      Overshadowing and blocking are better explained by the choice of an
      appropriate rule for changing a, such that a decreases to stimuli that
      signal no change from the probability of reinforcement predicted by other
      stimuli. (65 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights

AB  - The present study assessed three hypotheses of how practice reduces
      dual-task interference: Practice teaches participants to efficiently
      integrate performance of a task pair; practice promotes automatization of
      individual tasks, allowing the central bottleneck to be bypassed; practice
      leaves the bottleneck intact but shorter in duration. These hypotheses
      were tested in two transfer-of-training experiments. Participants received
      one of three training types (Task 1 only, or Task 2 only, or dual-task),
      followed by dual-task test sessions. Practice effects in Experiment 1
      (Task 1: auditory-vocal; Task 2: visual-manual) were fully explained by
      the intact bottleneck hypothesis, without task integration or
      automatization. This hypothesis also accounted well for the majority of
      participants when the task order was reversed (Experiment 2). In this
      case, however, there were multiple indicators that several participants
      had succeeded in eliminating the bottleneck by automatizing one or both
      tasks. Neither experiment provided any evidence that practice promotes
      efficient task integration.

AB  - Stimuli associated with high rewards evoke stronger neuronal activity than
      stimuli associated with lower rewards in many brain regions. It is not
      well understood how these reward effects influence activity in sensory
      cortices that represent low-level stimulus features. Here, we investigated
      the effects of reward information in the primary visual cortex (area V1)
      of monkeys. We found that the reward value of a stimulus relative to the
      value of other stimuli is a good predictor of V1 activity. Relative value
      biases the competition between stimuli, just as has been shown for
      selective attention. The neuronal latency of this reward value effect in
      V1 was similar to the latency of attentional influences. Moreover, V1
      neurons with a strong value effect also exhibited a strong attention
      effect, which implies that relative value and top-down attention engage
      overlapping, if not identical, neuronal selection mechanisms. Our findings
      demonstrate that the effects of reward value reach down to the earliest
      sensory processing levels of the cerebral cortex and imply that theories
      about the effects of reward coding and top-down attention on visual
      representations should be unified.

AB  - The primary visual cortex (V1) is widely regarded as faithfully conveying
      the physical properties of visual stimuli. Thus, experience-induced
      changes in V1 are often interpreted as improving visual perception (i.e.,
      perceptual learning). Here we describe how, with experience, cue-evoked
      oscillations emerge in V1 to convey expected reward time as well as to
      relate experienced reward rate. We show, in chronic multisite local field
      potential recordings from rat V1, that repeated presentation of visual
      cues induces the emergence of visually evoked oscillatory activity. Early
      in training, the visually evoked oscillations relate to the physical
      parameters of the stimuli. However, with training, the oscillations evolve
      to relate the time in which those stimuli foretell expected reward.
      Moreover, the oscillation prevalence reflects the reward rate recently
      experienced by the animal. Thus, training induces experience-dependent
      changes in V1 activity that relate to what those stimuli have come to
      signify behaviorally: when to expect future reward and at what rate.

AB  - Neurons in rodent primary visual cortex (V1) relate operantly conditioned
      stimulus-reward intervals with modulated patterns of spiking output, but
      little is known about the locus or mechanism of this plasticity. Here we
      show that cholinergic basal forebrain projections to V1 are necessary for
      the neural acquisition, but not the expression, of reward timing in the
      visual cortex of awake, behaving animals. We then mimic reward timing in
      vitro by pairing white matter stimulation with muscarinic receptor
      activation at a fixed interval and show that this protocol results in the
      prolongation of electrically evoked spike train durations out to the
      conditioned interval. Together, these data suggest that V1 possesses the
      circuitry and plasticity to support reward time prediction learning and
      the cholinergic system serves as an important reinforcement signal which,
      in vivo, conveys to the cortex the outcome of behavior.

AB  - The fundamental biological importance of rewards has created an increasing
      interest in the neuronal processing of reward information. The suggestion
      that the mechanisms underlying drug addiction might involve natural reward
      systems has also stimulated interest. This article focuses on recent
      neurophysiological studies in primates that have revealed that neurons in
      a limited number of brain structures carry specific signals about past and
      future rewards. This research provides the first step towards an
      understanding of how rewards influence behaviour before they are received
      and how the brain might use reward information to control learning and
      goal-directed behaviour.

AB  - Economists and cognitive psychologists have long known that prior rewards
      bias decision making in favor of options with high expected value.
      Accordingly, value modulates the activity of sensorimotor neurons involved
      in initiating movements toward one of two competing decision alternatives.
      However, little is known about how value influences the acquisition and
      representation of incoming sensory information or about the neural
      mechanisms that track the relative value of each available stimulus to
      guide behavior. Here, fMRI revealed value-related modulations throughout
      spatially selective areas of the human visual system in the absence of
      overt saccadic responses (including in V1). These modulations were
      primarily associated with the reward history of each stimulus and not to
      self-reported estimates of stimulus value. Finally, subregions of frontal
      and parietal cortex represent the differential value of competing
      alternatives and may provide signals to bias spatially selective visual
      areas in favor of more valuable stimuli.

AB  - A central concern in the study of learning and decision-making is the
      identification of neural signals associated with the values of choice
      alternatives. An important factor in understanding the neural correlates
      of value is the representation of the object itself, separate from the act
      of choosing. Is it the case that the representation of an object within
      visual areas will change if it is associated with a particular value? We
      used fMRI adaptation to measure the neural similarity of a set of novel
      objects before and after participants learned to associate monetary values
      with the objects. We used a range of both positive and negative values to
      allow us to distinguish effects of behavioral salience (i.e., large vs.
      small values) from effects of valence (i.e., positive vs. negative
      values). During the scanning session, participants made a perceptual
      judgment unrelated to value. Crucially, the similarity of the visual
      features of any pair of objects did not predict the similarity of their
      value, so we could distinguish adaptation effects due to each dimension of
      similarity. Within early visual areas, we found that value similarity
      modulated the neural response to the objects after training. These results
      show that an abstract dimension, in this case, monetary value, modulates
      neural response to an object in visual areas of the brain even when
      attention is diverted.

AB  - After more than a century of work concentrating on the motor functions of
      the basal ganglia, new ideas have emerged, suggesting that the basal
      ganglia also have major functions in relation to learning habits and
      acquiring motor skills. We review the evidence supporting the role of the
      striatum in optimizing behavior by refining action selection and in
      shaping habits and skills as a modulator of motor repertoires. These
      findings challenge the notion that striatal learning processes are limited
      to the motor domain. The learning mechanisms supported by striatal
      circuitry generalize to other domains, including cognitive skills and
      emotion-related patterns of action.

AB  - Negotiating the information-rich sensory world often requires the
      concurrent management of multiple tasks. Despite this requirement, humans
      are thought to be poor at multitasking because of the processing
      limitations of frontoparietal and subcortical (FP-SC) brain regions.
      Although training is known to improve multitasking performance, it is
      unknown how the FP-SC system functionally changes to support improved
      multitasking. To address this question, we characterized the FP-SC changes
      that predict training outcomes using an individual differences approach.
      Participants (n = 100) performed single and multiple tasks in pre- and
      posttraining magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions interspersed by
      either a multitasking or an active-control training regimen. Multivoxel
      pattern analyses (MVPA) revealed that training induced multitasking
      improvements were predicted by divergence in the FP-SC blood oxygen
      level-dependent (BOLD) response patterns to the trained tasks.
      Importantly, this finding was only observed for participants who completed
      training on the component (single) tasks and their combination (multitask)
      and not for the control group. Therefore, the FP-SC system supports
      multitasking behavior by segregating constituent task representations.

AB  - Voluntary and stimulus-driven shifts of attention can modulate the
      representation of behaviorally relevant stimuli in early areas of visual
      cortex. In turn, attended items are processed faster and more accurately,
      facilitating the selection of appropriate behavioral responses.
      Information processing is also strongly influenced by past experience and
      recent studies indicate that the learned value of a stimulus can influence
      relatively late stages of decision making such as the process of selecting
      a motor response. However, the learned value of a stimulus can also
      influence the magnitude of cortical responses in early sensory areas such
      as V1 and S1. These early effects of stimulus value are presumed to
      improve the quality of sensory representations; however, the nature of
      these modulations is not clear. They could reflect nonspecific changes in
      response amplitude associated with changes in general arousal or they
      could reflect a bias in population responses so that high-value features
      are represented more robustly. To examine this issue, subjects performed a
      two-alternative forced choice paradigm with a variable-interval payoff
      schedule to dynamically manipulate the relative value of two stimuli
      defined by their orientation (one was rotated clockwise from vertical, the
      other counterclockwise). Activation levels in visual cortex were monitored
      using functional MRI and feature-selective voxel tuning functions while
      subjects performed the behavioral task. The results suggest that value not
      only modulates the relative amplitude of responses in early areas of human
      visual cortex, but also sharpens the response profile across the
      populations of feature-selective neurons that encode the critical stimulus
      feature (orientation). Moreover, changes in space- or feature-based
      attention cannot easily explain the results because representations of
      both the selected and the unselected stimuli underwent a similar
      feature-selective modulation. This sharpening in the population response
      profile could theoretically improve the probability of correctly
      discriminating high-value stimuli from low-value alternatives.

AB  - Attention selects which aspects of sensory input are brought to awareness.
      To promote survival and well-being, attention prioritizes stimuli both
      voluntarily, according to context-specific goals (e.g., searching for car
      keys), and involuntarily, through attentional capture driven by physical
      salience (e.g., looking toward a sudden noise). Valuable stimuli strongly
      modulate voluntary attention allocation, but there is little evidence that
      high-value but contextually irrelevant stimuli capture attention as a
      consequence of reward learning. Here we show that visual search for a
      salient target is slowed by the presence of an inconspicuous,
      task-irrelevant item that was previously associated with monetary reward
      during a brief training session. Thus, arbitrary and otherwise neutral
      stimuli imbued with value via associative learning capture attention
      powerfully and persistently during extinction, independently of goals and
      salience. Vulnerability to such value-driven attentional capture covaries
      across individuals with working memory capacity and trait impulsivity.
      This unique form of attentional capture may provide a useful model for
      investigating failures of cognitive control in clinical syndromes in which
      value assigned to stimuli conflicts with behavioral goals (e.g.,
      addiction, obesity).

AB  - A central question in the field of attention is whether visual processing
      is a strictly limited resource, which must be allocated by selective
      attention. If this were the case, attentional enhancement of one stimulus
      should invariably lead to suppression of unattended distracter stimuli.
      Here we examine voluntary cued shifts of feature-selective attention to
      either one of two superimposed red or blue random dot kinematograms (RDKs)
      to test whether such a reciprocal relationship between enhancement of an
      attended and suppression of an unattended stimulus can be observed. The
      steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), an oscillatory brain
      response elicited by the flickering RDKs, was measured in human EEG.
      Supporting limited resources, we observed both an enhancement of the
      attended and a suppression of the unattended RDK, but this observed
      reciprocity did not occur concurrently: enhancement of the attended RDK
      started at 220 ms after cue onset and preceded suppression of the
      unattended RDK by about 130 ms. Furthermore, we found that behavior was
      significantly correlated with the SSVEP time course of a measure of
      selectivity (attended minus unattended) but not with a measure of total
      activity (attended plus unattended). The significant deviations from a
      temporally synchronized reciprocity between enhancement and suppression
      suggest that the enhancement of the attended stimulus may cause the
      suppression of the unattended stimulus in the present experiment.

AB  - The equilibrium phenomenon of matching behavior traditionally has been
      studied in stationary environments. Here we attempt to uncover the local
      mechanism of choice that gives rise to matching by studying behavior in a
      highly dynamic foraging environment. In our experiments, 2 rhesus monkeys
      (Macacca mulatta) foraged for juice rewards by making eye movements to one
      of two colored icons presented on a computer monitor, each rewarded on
      dynamic variable-interval schedules. Using a generalization of Wiener
      kernel analysis, we recover a compact mechanistic description of the
      impact of past reward on future choice in the form of a
      Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson model. We validate this model through rigorous
      predictive and generative testing. Compared to our earlier work with this
      same data set, this model proves to be a better description of choice
      behavior and is more tightly correlated with putative neural value
      signals. Refinements over previous models include hyperbolic (as opposed
      to exponential) temporal discounting of past rewards, and differential (as
      opposed to fractional) comparisons of option value. Through numerical
      simulation we find that within this class of strategies, the model
      parameters employed by animals are very close to those that maximize
      reward harvesting efficiency.

AB  - Psychologists and economists have long appreciated the contribution of
      reward history and expectation to decision-making. Yet we know little
      about how specific histories of choice and reward lead to an internal
      representation of the "value" of possible actions. We approached this
      problem through an integrated application of behavioral, computational,
      and physiological techniques. Monkeys were placed in a dynamic foraging
      environment in which they had to track the changing values of alternative
      choices through time. In this context, the monkeys' foraging behavior
      provided a window into their subjective valuation. We found that a simple
      model based on reward history can duplicate this behavior and that neurons
      in the parietal cortex represent the relative value of competing actions
      predicted by this model.

AB  - How does the brain learn those visual features that are relevant for
      behavior? In this article, we focus on two factors that guide plasticity
      of visual representations. First, reinforcers cause the global release of
      diffusive neuromodulatory signals that gate plasticity. Second,
      attentional feedback signals highlight the chain of neurons between
      sensory and motor cortex responsible for the selected action. We here
      propose that the attentional feedback signals guide learning by
      suppressing plasticity of irrelevant features while permitting the
      learning of relevant ones. By hypothesizing that sensory signals that are
      too weak to be perceived can escape from this inhibitory feedback, we
      bring attentional learning theories and theories that emphasized the
      importance of neuromodulatory signals into a single, unified framework.

AB  - Covert attention, the selective processing of visual information in the
      absence of eye movements, improves behavioral performance. We found that
      attention, both exogenous (involuntary) and endogenous (voluntary), can
      affect performance by contrast or response gain changes, depending on the
      stimulus size and the relative size of the attention field. These two
      variables were manipulated in a cueing task while stimulus contrast was
      varied. We observed a change in behavioral performance consonant with a
      change in contrast gain for small stimuli paired with spatial uncertainty
      and a change in response gain for large stimuli presented at one location
      (no uncertainty) and surrounded by irrelevant flanking distracters. A
      complementary neuroimaging experiment revealed that observers' attention
      fields were wider with than without spatial uncertainty. Our results
      support important predictions of the normalization model of attention and
      reconcile previous, seemingly contradictory findings on the effects of
      visual attention.

AB  - Over the last several decades, spatial attention has been shown to
      influence the activity of neurons in visual cortex in various ways. These
      conflicting observations have inspired competing models to account for the
      influence of attention on perception and behavior. Here, we used
      electroencephalography (EEG) to assess steady-state visual evoked
      potentials (SSVEP) in human subjects and showed that highly focused
      spatial attention primarily enhanced neural responses to high-contrast
      stimuli (response gain), whereas distributed attention primarily enhanced
      responses to medium-contrast stimuli (contrast gain). Together, these data
      suggest that different patterns of neural modulation do not reflect
      fundamentally different neural mechanisms, but instead reflect changes in
      the spatial extent of attention.

AB  - It is well established that attention modulates visual processing in
      extrastriate cortex. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are
      unknown. A consistent observation is that attention has its greatest
      impact on neuronal responses when multiple stimuli appear together within
      a cell's receptive field. One way to explain this is to assume that
      multiple stimuli activate competing populations of neurons and that
      attention biases this competition in favor of the attended stimulus. In
      the absence of competing stimuli, there is no competition to be resolved.
      Accordingly, attention has a more limited effect on the neuronal response
      to a single stimulus. To test this interpretation, we measured the
      responses of neurons in macaque areas V2 and V4 using a behavioral
      paradigm that allowed us to isolate automatic sensory processing
      mechanisms from attentional effects. First, we measured each cell's
      response to a single stimulus presented alone inside the receptive field
      or paired with a second receptive field stimulus, while the monkey
      attended to a location outside the receptive field. Adding the second
      stimulus typically caused the neuron's response to move toward the
      response that was elicited by the second stimulus alone. Then, we directed
      the monkey's attention to one element of the pair. This drove the neuron's
      response toward the response elicited when the attended stimulus appeared
      alone. These findings are consistent with the idea that attention biases
      competitive interactions among neurons, causing them to respond primarily
      to the attended stimulus. A quantitative neural model of attention is
      proposed to account for these results.

AB  - Attention has been found to have a wide variety of effects on the
      responses of neurons in visual cortex. We describe a model of attention
      that exhibits each of these different forms of attentional modulation,
      depending on the stimulus conditions and the spread (or selectivity) of
      the attention field in the model. The model helps reconcile proposals that
      have been taken to represent alternative theories of attention. We argue
      that the variety and complexity of the results reported in the literature
      emerge from the variety of empirical protocols that were used, such that
      the results observed in any one experiment depended on the stimulus
      conditions and the subject's attentional strategy, a notion that we define
      precisely in terms of the attention field in the model, but that has not
      typically been completely under experimental control.

AB  - Attention acts, through cortical feedback pathways, to enhance the
      response of cells encoding expected or predicted information. Such
      observations are inconsistent with the predictive coding theory of
      cortical function which proposes that feedback acts to suppress
      information predicted by higher-level cortical regions. Despite this
      discrepancy, this article demonstrates that the predictive coding model
      can be used to simulate a number of the effects of attention. This is
      achieved via a simple mathematical rearrangement of the predictive coding
      model, which allows it to be interpreted as a form of biased competition
      model. Nonlinear extensions to the model are proposed that enable it to
      explain a wider range of data.

AB  - The visual world is typically too complex to permit full apprehension of
      its content from a single fixation. Humans therefore use visual search to
      direct attention and eye movements to locations or objects of interest in
      cluttered scenes. Psychophysical investigations have revealed that
      observers can select target elements from within an array of distractors
      on the basis of their spatial location or simple features, such as color.
      It remains unclear, however, how stimuli that lie outside the current
      search array are represented in the visual system. To investigate this, we
      recorded continuous neural activity using EEG while participants searched
      a foveal array of colored targets and distractors, and ignored irrelevant
      objects in the periphery. Search targets were defined either by a unique
      feature within the array or by a conjunction of features. Objects outside
      the array could match the target or distractor color within the array, or
      otherwise possessed a baseline (neutral) color present only in the
      periphery. The search array and irrelevant peripheral objects flickered at
      unique rates and thus evoked distinct frequency-tagged neural
      oscillations. During conjunction but not unique-feature search,
      target-colored objects outside the array evoked enhanced activity relative
      to distractor-colored and neutral objects. The results suggest that
      feature-based selection applies to stimuli at ignored peripheral
      locations, but only when central targets compete with distractors within
      the array. Distractor-colored and neutral objects evoked equivalent
      oscillatory responses, suggesting that feature-based selection at ignored
      locations during visual search arises exclusively from enhancement rather
      than suppression of neural activity.

T2  - Psychon. Bull. Rev.
PY  - 2017

AB  - Visual attention enables us to selectively prioritize or suppress
      information in the environment. Prominent models concerned with the
      control of visual attention differentiate between goal-directed, top-down
      and stimulus-driven, bottom-up control, with the former determined by
      current selection goals and the latter determined by physical salience. In
      the current review, we discuss recent studies that demonstrate that
      attentional selection does not need to be the result of top-down or
      bottom-up processing but, instead, is often driven by lingering biases due
      to the "history" of former attention deployments. This review mainly
      focuses on reward-based history effects; yet other types of history
      effects such as (intertrial) priming, statistical learning and affective
      conditioning are also discussed. We argue that evidence from behavioral,
      eye-movement and neuroimaging studies supports the idea that selection
      history modulates the topographical landscape of spatial "priority" maps,
      such that attention is biased toward locations having the highest
      activation on this map.

AB  - Schumacher et al. Psychological Science 12:101-108, (2001) demonstrated
      the elimination of most dual-task costs ("perfect time-sharing") after
      extensive dual-task practice of a visual and an auditory task in
      combination. For the present research, we used a transfer methodology to
      examine this practice effect in more detail, asking what task-processing
      stages were sped up by this dual-task practice. Such research will be
      essential to specify mechanisms associated with the practice-related
      elimination of dual-task costs. In three experiments, we introduced
      postpractice transfer probes focusing on the perception, central
      response-selection, and final motor-response stages. The results indicated
      that the major change achieved by dual-task practice was a speed-up in the
      central response-selection stages of both tasks. Additionally,
      perceptual-stage shortening of the auditory task was found to contribute
      to the improvements in time-sharing. For a better understanding of such
      time-sharing, we discuss the contributions of the present findings in
      relation to models of practiced dual-task performance.

AB  - Cognitive flexibility is fundamental to adaptive intelligent behavior.
      Prefrontal cortex has long been associated with flexible cognitive
      function, but the neurophysiological principles that enable prefrontal
      cells to adapt their response properties according to context-dependent
      rules remain poorly understood. Here, we use time-resolved
      population-level neural pattern analyses to explore how context is encoded
      and maintained in primate prefrontal cortex and used in flexible decision
      making. We show that an instruction cue triggers a rapid series of state
      transitions before settling into a stable low-activity state. The postcue
      state is differentially tuned according to the current task-relevant rule.
      During decision making, the response to a choice stimulus is characterized
      by an initial stimulus-specific population response but evolves to
      different final decision-related states depending on the current rule.
      These results demonstrate how neural tuning profiles in prefrontal cortex
      adapt to accommodate changes in behavioral context. Highly flexible tuning
      could be mediated via short-term synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Cognition is organized in a structured series of attentional episodes,
      allowing complex problems to be addressed through solution of simpler
      subproblems. A "multiple-demand" (MD) system of frontal and parietal
      cortex is active in many different kinds of tasks, and using data from
      neuroimaging, electrophysiology, neuropsychology, and cognitive studies of
      intelligence, I propose a core role for MD regions in assembly of the
      attentional episode. Monkey and human data show dynamic neural coding of
      attended information across multiple MD regions, with rapid communication
      within and between regions. Neuropsychological and imaging data link MD
      function to fluid intelligence, explaining some but not all "executive"
      deficits after frontal lobe lesions. Cognitive studies link fluid
      intelligence to goal neglect, and the problem of dividing complex task
      requirements into focused parts. Like the innate releasing mechanism of
      ethology, I suggest that construction of the attentional episode provides
      a core organizational principle for complex, adaptive cognition.

AB  - To determine the organization of visual inputs and outputs of the
      striatum, we placed multiple retrograde and anterograde tracers into
      physiologically identified portions of the striatum known to receive
      inputs from visual cortex in seven macaques. The injection sites included
      the tail and genu of the caudate nucleus (14 cases), the head of the
      caudate (1 case), and the ventral putamen (3 cases). Retrogradely labeled
      cells were located predominantly in layer 5 of the ipsilateral cortex but
      were also found in layers 3 and 6. After caudate injections, labeled cells
      were found both in large, nearly continuous regions of cortex
      topographically related to the site of the injection, and in several
      smaller cortical regions that were discontinuous and common to many or all
      of the injection sites. The continuously labeled regions included nearly
      all known visual cortical areas, except for the striate cortex. After
      injections in the rostral tail, the continuously labeled region included
      the rostral portion of Bonin and Bailey's (Urbana: University of Illinois
      Press. '47) area TE and adjacent portions of TF, TH, TG, and,
      occasionally, area 35 (Brodmann, Leipzig: J.A. Barth. '09). After
      injections into the posterior tail and ventral genu, the labeled region
      shifted posteriorly in TE and TF, and into TEO and the ventral parts of
      prestriate areas V4, V3, and (sparsely) V2. As the injection site was
      advanced into the dorsal genu, the labeled region shifted dorsally toward
      the parietal lobe, including prestriate areas MT and PO, parietal area PG
      (Brodmann's area 7), the ventral and lateral intraparietal sulcal areas
      (VIP and LIP, respectively), and area PE and adjacent area LC (Brodmann's
      areas 5 and 23, respectively). The discontinuous areas labeled by many
      different injections included the principal sulcus/frontal eye field
      region, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the superior temporal
      polysensory area. Thus, whereas temporal, occipital, and parietal visual
      cortical areas project into the caudate largely according to proximity,
      certain multimodal cortical areas seem to have a much wider projection. To
      determine whether visual cortical areas have additional projections to the
      caudate beyond the territory of our retrograde injection sites in the tail
      and genu. 3H-labeled amino acids were injected into areas TE, V4, and MT
      in three additional monkeys. The topographic location of label in the tail
      and genu of the caudate in these cases was consistent with the results
      from injections of retrograde tracers into the caudate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED

AB  - Selective visual attention describes the tendency of visual processing to
      be confined largely to stimuli that are relevant to behavior. It is among
      the most fundamental of cognitive functions, particularly in humans and
      other primates for whom vision is the dominant sense. We review recent
      progress in identifying the neural mechanisms of selective visual
      attention. We discuss evidence from studies of different varieties of
      selective attention and examine how these varieties alter the processing
      of stimuli by neurons within the visual system, current knowledge of their
      causal basis, and methods for assessing attentional dysfunctions. In
      addition, we identify some key questions that remain in identifying the
      neural mechanisms that give rise to the selective processing of visual
      information.

      expressing uncertainty in data. Loftus and Masson (1994) describe
      confidence intervals for means in within-subjects designs. These
      confidence intervals are based on the ANOVA mean squared error. Cousineau
      (2005) presents an alternative to the Loftus and Masson method, but his
      method produces confidence intervals that are smaller than those of Loftus
      and Masson. I show why this is the case and offer a simple correction that
      makes the expected size of Cousineau confidence intervals the same as that
      of Loftus and Masson confidence intervals.

AB  - Behavior varies from trial to trial even when the stimulus is maintained
      as constant as possible. In many models, this variability is attributed to
      noise in the brain. Here, we propose that there is another major source of
      variability: suboptimal inference. Importantly, we argue that in most
      tasks of interest, and particularly complex ones, suboptimal inference is
      likely to be the dominant component of behavioral variability. This
      perspective explains a variety of intriguing observations, including why
      variability appears to be larger on the sensory than on the motor side,
      and why our sensors are sometimes surprisingly unreliable.

AB  - Prominent models of attentional control assert a dichotomy between
      top-down and bottom-up control, with the former determined by current
      selection goals and the latter determined by physical salience. This
      theoretical dichotomy, however, fails to explain a growing number of cases
      in which neither current goals nor physical salience can account for
      strong selection biases. For example, equally salient stimuli associated
      with reward can capture attention, even when this contradicts current
      selection goals. Thus, although 'top-down' sources of bias are sometimes
      defined as those that are not due to physical salience, this conception
      conflates distinct--and sometimes contradictory--sources of selection
      bias. We describe an alternative framework, in which past selection
      history is integrated with current goals and physical salience to shape an
      integrated priority map.

AB  - Bayes factors have been advocated as superior to p -values for assessing
      statistical evidence in data. Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and
      the drawbacks of p -values, inference by p -values is still nearly
      ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of
      practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and
      algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes
      factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate
      generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the
      desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear
      transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are
      computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are
      provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including
      random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and
      mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with
      continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be
      applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in
      differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill
      acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of
      Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in
      experimental psychology.

AB  - Recent decisions about actions and goals can have effects on future
      choices. Several studies have shown an effect of the previous trial
      history on neural activity in a subsequent trial. Often, but not always,
      these effects originate from task requirements that make it necessary to
      maintain access to previous trial information to make future decisions.
      Maintaining the information about recent decisions and their outcomes can
      play an important role in both adapting to new contingencies and learning.
      Previous goal decisions must be distinguished from goals that are
      currently being planned to avoid perseveration or more general errors.
      Output monitoring is probably based on this separation of accomplished
      past goals from pending future goals that are being pursued.
      Behaviourally, it has been shown that the history context can influence
      the location, error rate and latency of successive responses. We will
      review the neurophysiological studies in the literature, including data
      from our laboratory, which support a role for the frontal lobe in tracking
      previous goal selections and outputs when new goals need to be
      accomplished.

AB  - Neuronal signals related to visual attention are found in widespread brain
      regions, and these signals are generally assumed to participate in a
      common mechanism of attention. However, the behavioral effects of
      attention in detection can be separated into two distinct components:
      spatially selective shifts in either the criterion or sensitivity of the
      subject. Here we show that a paradigm used by many single-neuron studies
      of attention conflates behavioral changes in the subject's criterion and
      sensitivity. Then, using a task designed to dissociate these two
      components, we found that multiple aspects of attention-related neuronal
      modulations in area V4 of monkey visual cortex corresponded to behavioral
      shifts in sensitivity, but not criterion. This result suggests that
      separate components of attention are associated with signals in different
      brain regions and that attention is not a unitary process in the brain,
      but instead consists of distinct neurobiological mechanisms.

AB  - The rat visual system comprises cortical and subcortical pathways. The
      receptive field properties of cells in the visual cortex have been
      extensively studied; however, the fundamental roles of the two circuits in
      visual information processing are not well understood. To address this
      question, we have applied quantitative methods to compare and characterize
      the spatiotemporal receptive field (RF) properties of neurons in primary
      visual cortex (V1) cells and superficial layers of the superior colliculus
      (SC) in rats by means of extracellular recordings. An analysis of visual
      stimulus processing revealed distinct functional characteristics of the
      two visual circuits. RF diameters of SC neurons were significantly larger
      than those of V1 cells. Most cells in both regions had high orientation
      selectivity, but the mean orientation bandwidth of the SC was broader than
      that of V1 cells (101.5° vs. 60.2°). The mean optimal spatial frequency
      (SF) of SC cells was lower but had a broader bandwidth than that of V1
      cells (0.03 vs. 0.068 cpd). The majority of SC and V1 cells (70% and 68%,
      respectively) had RFs with band-pass temporal frequency (TF) tuning
      profiles and similar optimal TFs. However, temporal band-pass profiles of
      the SC showed narrower mean temporal bandwidths than those of V1 cells
      (1.42 vs. 2.36 octaves). The majority of neurons in visual cortical and
      subcortical structures were activated in response to high-contrast,
      drifting gratings in the preferred orientation. The percentage of V1
      neurons with a low-contrast threshold was larger than the proportion of SC
      neurons (45.6% vs. 30%), indicating that the former adapt better to
      contrast. The substantial overlap in latency distributions between SC and
      V1 areas suggests that the two visual systems process and analyze visual
      signals in parallel. However, the two areas use different neural encoding
      mechanisms based on different latency distribution trends. These results
      indicate that SC cells have poor spatial acuity and are better suited to
      detecting high-contrast, moving stimuli in larger visual fields. In
      contrast, V1 cells are adapted to extracting shape information and
      detailed features of objects.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Executive control of voluntary movements is a hallmark of the
      mammalian brain. In the gaze-control network, this function is thought to
      be mediated by a critical balance between neurons responsible for
      generating movements and those responsible for fixating or suppressing
      movements, but the nature of this balance between the relevant
      elements-saccade-generating and fixation-related neurons-remains unclear.
      Specifically, it has been debated whether the two functions are
      necessarily coupled (i.e., push-and-pull) or independently controlled.
      Here we show that behavioral perturbation of ongoing fixation with the
      trigeminal blink reflex in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) alters the effective
      balance between fixation and saccade-generating neurons in the superior
      colliculus (SC) and can lead to premature gaze shifts reminiscent of
      compromised inhibitory control. The shift in balance is primarily driven
      by an increase in the activity of visuomovement neurons in the caudal SC,
      and the extent to which fixation-related neurons in the rostral SC play a
      role seems to be linked to the animal's propensity to make microsaccades.
      The perturbation also reveals a hitherto unknown feature of sensorimotor
      integration: the presence of a hidden visual response in canonical
      movement neurons. These findings offer new insights into the latent
      functional interactions, or lack thereof, between components of the
      gaze-control network, suggesting that the perturbation technique used here
      may prove to be a useful tool for probing the neural mechanisms of
      movement generation in executive function and dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE
      STATEMENT: Eye movements are an integral part of how we explore the
      environment. Although we know a great deal about where sensorimotor
      transformations leading to saccadic eye movements are implemented in the
      brain, less is known about the functional interactions between neurons
      that maintain gaze fixation and neurons that program saccades. In this
      study, we used a novel approach to study these interactions. By transient
      disruption of fixation, we found that activity of saccade-generating
      neurons can increase independently of modulation in fixation-related
      neurons, which may occasionally lead to premature movements mimicking lack
      of impulse control. Our findings support the notion of a common pathway
      for sensory and movement processing and suggest that impulsive movements
      arise when sensory processes become "motorized."

AB  - Eye movements are often influenced by expectation of reward. Using a
      memory-guided saccade task with an asymmetric reward schedule, we show
      that visual responses of monkey SC neurons increase when the visual
      stimulus indicates an upcoming reward. The increase occurred in two
      distinct manners: (1) reactively, as an increase in the gain of the visual
      response when the stimulus indicated an upcoming reward; (2) proactively,
      as an increase in anticipatory activity when reward was expected in the
      neuron's response field. These effects were observed mostly in
      saccade-related SC neurons in the deeper layer which would receive inputs
      from the cortical eye fields and the basal ganglia. These results,
      together with recent findings, suggest that the gain modulation may be
      determined by the inputs from both the cortical eye fields and the basal
      ganglia, whereas the anticipatory bias may be derived mainly from the
      basal ganglia.

AB  - A subset of caudate neurons fires before cues that instruct the monkey
      what he should do. To test the hypothesis that the anticipatory activity
      of such neurons depends on the context of stimulus-reward mapping, we
      examined their activity while the monkeys performed a memory-guided
      saccade task in which either the position or the color of a cue indicated
      presence or absence of reward. Some neurons showed anticipatory activity
      only when a particular position was associated with reward, while others
      fired selectively for color-reward associations. The functional
      segregation suggests that caudate neurons participate in feature-based
      anticipation of visual information that predicts reward. This neuronal
      code influences the general activity level in response to visual features
      without improving the quality of visual discrimination.

AB  - Unexpected, biologically salient stimuli elicit a short-latency, phasic
      response in midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. Although this signal is
      important for reinforcement learning, the information it conveys to
      forebrain target structures remains uncertain. One way to decode the
      phasic DA signal would be to determine the perceptual properties of
      sensory inputs to DA neurons. After local disinhibition of the superior
      colliculus in anesthetized rats, DA neurons became visually responsive,
      whereas disinhibition of the visual cortex was ineffective. As the primary
      source of visual afferents, the limited processing capacities of the
      colliculus may constrain the visual information content of phasic DA
      responses.

AB  - The basal ganglia and frontal cortex operate together to execute goal
      directed behaviors. This requires not only the execution of motor plans,
      but also the behaviors that lead to this execution, including emotions and
      motivation that drive behaviors, cognition that organizes and plans the
      general strategy, motor planning, and finally, the execution of that plan.
      The components of the frontal cortex that mediate these behaviors, are
      reflected in the organization, physiology, and connections between areas
      of frontal cortex and in their projections through basal ganglia circuits.
      This comprises a series of parallel pathways. However, this model does not
      address how information flows between circuits thereby developing new
      learned behaviors (or actions) from a combination of inputs from
      emotional, cognitive, and motor cortical areas. Recent anatomical evidence
      from primates demonstrates that the neuro-networks within basal ganglia
      pathways are in a position to move information across functional circuits.
      Two networks are: the striato-nigral-striatal network and the
      thalamo-cortical-thalamic network. Within each of these sets of connected
      structures, there are both reciprocal connections linking up regions
      associated with similar functions and non-reciprocal connections linking
      up regions that are associated with different cortical basal ganglia
      circuits. Each component of information (from limbic to motor outcome)
      sends both feedback connection, and also a feedforward connection,
      allowing the transfer of information. Information is channeled from
      limbic, to cognitive, to motor circuits. Action decision-making processes
      are thus influenced by motivation and cognitive inputs, allowing the
      animal to respond appropriate to environmental cues.

AB  - The human inferior parietal lobule (IPL) comprised the lateral bank of the
      intraparietal sulcus, angular gyrus, and supramarginal gyrus, defined on
      the basis of anatomical landmarks and cytoarchitectural organization of
      neurons. However, it is not clear as to whether the three areas represent
      functional subregions within the IPL. For instance, imaging studies
      frequently identified clusters of activities that cut across areal
      boundaries. Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) data to examine how individual voxels within the IPL are
      best clustered according to their connectivity to the whole brain. The
      results identified a best estimate of seven clusters that are
      hierarchically arranged as the anterior, middle, and posterior subregions.
      The anterior, middle, and posterior IPL are each significantly connected
      to the somatomotor areas, superior/middle/inferior frontal gyri, and
      regions of the default mode network. This functional segregation is
      supported by recent cytoarchitechtonics and tractography studies. IPL
      showed hemispheric differences in connectivity that accord with a
      predominantly left parietal role in tool use and language processing and a
      right parietal role in spatial attention and mathematical cognition. The
      functional clusters may also provide a more parsimonious and perhaps even
      accurate account of regional activations of the IPL during a variety of

AB  - The medial superior frontal cortex (SFC), including the supplementary
      motor area (SMA) and presupplementary motor area (preSMA), is implicated
      in movement and cognitive control, among other functions central to
      decision making. Previous studies delineated the anatomical boundaries and
      functional connectivity of the SMA. However, it is unclear whether the
      preSMA, which responds to a variety of behavioral tasks, comprises
      functionally distinct areas. With 24 seed regions systematically
      demarcated throughout the anterior and posterior medial SFC, we examined
      here the functional divisions of the medial SFC on the basis of the
      "correlograms" of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data
      of 225 adult individuals. In addition to replicating segregation of the
      SMA and posterior preSMA, the current results elucidated functional
      connectivities of anterior preSMA-the most anterior part of the medial
      SFC. In contrast to the caudal medial SFC, the anterior preSMA is
      connected with most of the prefrontal but not with somatomotor areas.
      Overall, the SMA is strongly connected to the thalamus and epithalamus,
      the posterior preSMA to putamen, pallidum, and subthalamic nucleus, and
      anterior preSMA to the caudate, with the caudate showing significant
      hemispheric asymmetry. These findings may provide a useful platform for
      future studies to investigate frontal cortical functions.

AB  - The dorsal premotor cortex is a functionally distinct cortical field or
      group of fields in the primate frontal cortex. Anatomical studies have
      confirmed that most parietal input to the dorsal premotor cortex
      originates from the superior parietal lobule. However, these projections
      arise not only from the dorsal aspect of area 5, as has long been known,
      but also from newly defined areas of posterior parietal cortex, which are
      directly connected with the extrastriate visual cortex. Thus, the dorsal
      premotor cortex receives much more direct visual input than previously
      accepted. It appears that this fronto-parietal network functions as a
      visuomotor controller-one that makes computations based on proprioceptive,
      visual, gaze, attentional, and other information to produce an output that
      reflects the selection, preparation, and execution of movements.

AB  - Current models of the visual pathways have difficulty incorporating the
      human inferior parietal lobe (IPL) into dorsal or ventral streams. Some
      recent proposals have attempted to integrate aspects of IPL function that
      were not hitherto dealt with well, such as differences between the left
      and right hemisphere and the role of the right IPL in responding to
      salient environmental events. However, we argue that these models also
      fail to capture adequately some important findings regarding the functions
      of the IPL. Here we critically appraise existing proposals regarding the
      functional architecture of the visual system, with special emphasis on the
      role of this region, particularly in the right hemisphere. We review
      evidence that shows the right IPL plays an important role in two
      different, but broadly complementary, aspects of attention: maintaining
      attentive control on current task goals as well as responding to salient
      new information or alerting stimuli in the environment. In our view,
      findings from functional imaging, electrophysiological and lesion studies
      are all consistent with the view that this region is part of a system that
      allows flexible reconfiguration of behaviour between these two alternative
      modes of operation. Damage to the right IPL leads to deficits in both
      maintaining attention and also responding to salient events, impairments
      that contribute to hemineglect, the classical syndrome that follows
      lesions of this region.

AB  - In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear
      input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the
      dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit
      causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that
      mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters
      that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear]
      parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification
      proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the
      observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the
      analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs
      and fMRI responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to
      effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in
      connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to
      characterise fMRI experiments, conceptually, as an experimental
      manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or
      trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using
      evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli).
      As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on
      experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic
      interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the
      causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as
      opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic.

AB  - This note derives the variational free energy under the Laplace
      approximation, with a focus on accounting for additional model complexity
      induced by increasing the number of model parameters. This is relevant
      when using the free energy as an approximation to the log-evidence in
      Bayesian model averaging and selection. By setting restricted maximum
      likelihood (ReML) in the larger context of variational learning and
      expectation maximisation (EM), we show how the ReML objective function can
      be adjusted to provide an approximation to the log-evidence for a
      particular model. This means ReML can be used for model selection,
      specifically to select or compare models with different covariance
      components. This is useful in the context of hierarchical models because
      it enables a principled selection of priors that, under simple
      hyperpriors, can be used for automatic model selection and relevance
      determination (ARD). Deriving the ReML objective function, from basic
      variational principles, discloses the simple relationships among
      Variational Bayes, EM and ReML. Furthermore, we show that EM is formally
      identical to a full variational treatment when the precisions are linear
      in the hyperparameters. Finally, we also consider, briefly, dynamic models
      and how these inform the regularisation of free energy ascent schemes,
      like EM and ReML.

      in normal and pathological conditions (e.g. Parkinson's and Huntington's
      diseases) have recently come under greater scrutiny. An update of these
      models is clearly timely, taking into consideration not only changes in
      neuronal discharge rates, but also changes in the patterning and
      synchronization of neuronal discharge, the role of extrastriatal dopamine,
      and expanded intrinsic and input/output connections of these nuclei.

AB  - In the 20th century it was thought that novel behaviors are mediated
      primarily in cortex and that the development of automaticity is a process
      of transferring control to subcortical structures. However, evidence
      supports the view that subcortical structures, such as the striatum, make
      significant contributions to initial learning. More recently, there has
      been increasing evidence that neurons in the associative striatum are
      selectively activated during early learning, whereas those in the
      sensorimotor striatum are more active after automaticity has developed. At
      the same time, other recent reports indicate that automatic behaviors are
      striatum- and dopamine-independent, and might be mediated entirely within
      cortex. Resolving this apparent conflict should be a major goal of future
      research.

AB  - Patients who show the "strategy application disorder" can show deficits
      restricted to situations requiring multitasking, but the precise
      neuroanatomical and cognitive correlates of this problem have been rarely
      investigated. In this study, 60 people with circumscribed cerebral lesions
      and 60 age- and IQ-matched controls were given a multitasking procedure
      which allowed consideration of the relative contributions of task learning
      and remembering, planning, plan-following and remembering one's actions to
      multitasking performance. Lesions to the left posterior cingulate and
      forceps major regions gave deficits on all measures except planning.
      Remembering task contingencies after a delay was also affected by lesions
      in the region of the left anterior cingulate, and rule-breaking and
      failures of task switching were additionally found in people with lesions
      affecting the medial and more polar aspects of Brodmann's areas 8, 9 and
      especially 10. Planning deficits were associated with lesions to the right
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (RDLPFC). A theory of the relationships
      between the cognitive constructs underpinning multitasking was tested
      using structural equation modelling. The results suggest that there are
      three primary constructs that support multitasking: retrospective memory,
      prospective memory, and planning, with the second two drawing upon the
      products of the first. It is tentatively suggested that the left anterior
      and posterior cingulates together play some part in the retrospective
      memory demands, while the prospective memory and planning components make
      demands on processes supported by the left areas 8, 9 and 10 and the
      RDLPFC respectively.

AB  - Although training-induced changes in brain activity have been previously
      examined, plasticity associated with executive functions remains
      understudied. In this study, we examined training-related changes in
      cortical activity during a dual task requiring executive control. Two
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions, one before training
      and one after training, were performed on both a control group and a
      training group. Using a region-of-interest analysis, we examined Time x
      Group and Time x Group x Condition interactions to isolate
      training-dependent changes in activation. We found that most regions
      involved in dual-task processing before training showed reductions in
      activation after training. Many of the decreases in activation were
      correlated with improved performance on the task. We also found an area in
      the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that showed an increase in activation
      for the training group for the dual-task condition, which was also
      correlated with improved performance. These results are discussed in
      relation to the efficacy of training protocols for modulating attention
      and executive functions, dual-task processing, and fMRI correlates of
      plasticity.

AB  - The discovery that experience-driven changes in the human brain can occur
      from a neural to a cortical level throughout the lifespan has stimulated a
      proliferation of research into how neural function changes in response to
      experience, enabled by neuroimaging methods such as positron emission
      tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Studies attempt to
      characterize these changes by examining how practice on a task affects the
      functional anatomy underlying performance. Results are incongruous,
      including patterns of increases, decreases and functional reorganization
      of regional activations. Following an extensive review of the
      practice-effects literature, we distinguish a number of factors affecting
      the pattern of practice effects observed, including the effects of task
      domain, changes at the level of behavioural and cognitive processes, the
      time-window of imaging and practice, and of a number of other influences
      and miscellaneous confounding factors. We make a novel distinction between
      patterns of reorganization and redistribution as effects of task practice
      on brain activation, and emphasize the need for careful attention to
      practice-related changes occurring on the behavioural, cognitive and
      neural levels of analysis. Finally, we suggest that functional and
      effective connectivity analyses may make important contributions to our
      understanding of changes in functional anatomy occurring as a result of
      practice on tasks.

AB  - Mathematical models of scientific data can be formally compared using
      Bayesian model evidence. Previous applications in the biological sciences
      have mainly focussed on model selection in which one first selects the
      model with the highest evidence and then makes inferences based on the
      parameters of that model. This "best model" approach is very useful but
      can become brittle if there are a large number of models to compare, and
      if different subjects use different models. To overcome this shortcoming
      we propose the combination of two further approaches: (i) family level
      inference and (ii) Bayesian model averaging within families. Family level
      inference removes uncertainty about aspects of model structure other than
      the characteristic of interest. For example: What are the inputs to the
      system? Is processing serial or parallel? Is it linear or nonlinear? Is it
      mediated by a single, crucial connection? We apply Bayesian model
      averaging within families to provide inferences about parameters that are
      independent of further assumptions about model structure. We illustrate
      the methods using Dynamic Causal Models of brain imaging data.

AB  - Corticostriatal connections play a central role in developing appropriate
      goal-directed behaviors, including the motivation and cognition to develop
      appropriate actions to obtain a specific outcome. The cortex projects to
      the striatum topographically. Thus, different regions of the striatum have
      been associated with these different functions: the ventral striatum with
      reward; the caudate nucleus with cognition; and the putamen with motor
      control. However, corticostriatal connections are more complex, and
      interactions between functional territories are extensive. These
      interactions occur in specific regions in which convergence of terminal
      fields from different functional cortical regions are found. This article
      provides an overview of the connections of the cortex to the striatum and
      their role in integrating information across reward, cognitive, and motor
      functions. Emphasis is placed on the interface between functional domains
      within the striatum.

AB  - Choosing the option with the highest expected value (EV; reward
      probability × reward magnitude) maximizes the intake of reward under
      conditions of uncertainty. However, human economic choices indicate that
      our value calculation has a subjective component whereby probability and
      reward magnitude are not linearly weighted. Using a similar economic
      framework, our goal was to characterize how subjective value influences
      the generation of simple motor actions. Specifically, we hypothesized that
      attributes of saccadic eye movements could provide insight into how rhesus
      monkeys, a well-studied animal model in cognitive neuroscience,
      subjectively value potential visual targets. In the first experiment,
      monkeys were free to choose by directing a saccade toward one of two
      simultaneously displayed targets, each of which had an uncertain outcome.
      In this task, choices were more likely to be allocated toward the higher
      valued target. In the second experiment, only one of the two possible
      targets appeared on each trial. In this task, saccadic reaction times
      (SRTs) decreased toward the higher valued target. Reward magnitude had a
      much stronger influence on both choices and SRTs than probability, whose
      effect was observed only when reward magnitude was similar for both
      targets. Across EV blocks, a strong relationship was observed between
      choice preferences and SRTs. However, choices tended to maximize at skewed
      values whereas SRTs varied more continuously. Lastly, SRTs were unchanged
      when all reward magnitudes were 1×, 1.5×, and 2× their normal amount,
      indicating that saccade preparation was influenced by the relative value
      of the targets rather than the absolute value of any single-target. We
      conclude that value is not only an important factor( )for deliberative
      decision making in primates, but also for the selection and preparation of
      simple motor actions, such as saccadic eye movements. More precisely, our
      results indicate that, under conditions of uncertainty, saccade choices
      and reaction times are influenced by the relative expected subjective
      value of potential movements.

AB  - Attention influences the processing of visual information even in the
      earliest areas of primate visual cortex. There is converging evidence that
      the interaction of bottom-up sensory information and top-down attentional
      influences creates an integrated saliency map, that is, a topographic
      representation of relative stimulus strength and behavioral relevance
      across visual space. This map appears to be distributed across areas of
      the visual cortex, and is closely linked to the oculomotor system that
      controls eye movements and orients the gaze to locations in the visual
      scene characterized by a high salience.

AB  - This study investigated the anatomical relationship between covert and
      overt shifts of attention. Previous studies have found that the areas of
      the brain activated by covert and overt shifts of attention are very
      similar. However, despite a general agreement between studies there are a
      few issues that merit closer inspection. Primarily, the tasks aiming to
      produce covert or overt shifts of attention were not always comparable.
      Secondly, the previous studies disagreed on whether greater neural
      activity is elicited by covert shifts or overt shifts of attention.
      Thirdly, the previous studies differed on whether the shifts of attention
      were exogenously or endogenously driven. Finally, the statistical analyses
      used by all previous studies failed to account for between subject
      variability. The present study was designed to address all these issues.
      Twelve healthy subjects performed either covert or overt shifts of
      attention while the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal
      was continuously measured. In line with the previous studies, the present
      study showed a virtually complete overlap between areas of the brain
      recruited during covert shifts of attention and areas of the brain
      recruited during overt shifts of attention. Furthermore, using
      endogenously driven shifts of attention this study found that overt shifts
      of attention resulted in higher levels of activation in the brain than
      covert shifts of attention. The results of this study provide support for
      the premotor theory of attention that posits that the attentional and
      motor systems are the result of neural activation in the same areas of the
      brain.

AB  - The traditional distinction between exogenous and endogenous attentional
      control has recently been enriched with an additional mode of control,
      termed "selection history." Recent findings have indicated, for instance,
      that previously rewarded or punished stimuli capture more attention than
      their physical attributes would predict. As such, the value that is
      associated with certain stimuli modulates attentional capture. This
      particular influence has also been shown for endogenous attention.
      Although recent leads have emerged, elucidating the influences of reward
      on exogenous and endogenous attention, it remains unclear to what extent
      exogenous attention is modulated by reward when endogenous attention is
      already deployed. We used a Posner cueing task in which exogenous and
      endogenous cues were presented to guide attention. Crucially, the
      exogenous cue also indicated the reward value. That is, the color of the
      exogenous cue indicated how much reward could be obtained on a given
      trial. The results showed main effects of endogenous and exogenous
      attention (i.e., speeded reaction times when either cue was valid, as
      compared to when it was invalid). Crucially, an interaction between
      exogenous cue validity and reward level was observed, indicating that
      reward-based associative-learning processes rapidly influence attentional
      capture, even when endogenous attention has been actively deployed.

AB  - This paper is conceived as a guide that will describe the very well known
      Spatial Orienting paradigm, used to explore attentional processes in
      healthy individuals as well as in people suffering from psychiatric
      disorders and brain-damaged patients. The paradigm was developed in the
      late 1970s, and since then, it has been used in thousands of attentional
      studies. In this review, we attempt to describe, the paradigm for the naïf
      reader, and explain in detail when is it used, which variables are usually
      manipulated, how to interpret its results, and how can it be adapted to
      different populations and methodologies. The main goal of this review is
      to provide a practical guide to researchers who have never used the
      paradigm that will help them design their experiments, as a function of
      their theoretical and experimental needs. We also focus on how to adapt
      the paradigm to different technologies (such as event-related potentials,
      functional resonance imaging, or transcranial magnetic stimulation), and
      to different populations by presenting an example of its use in
      brain-damaged patients.

AB  - Primates search for objects in the visual field with eye movements. We
      recorded the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP)
      in animals performing a visual search task in which they were free to move
      their eyes, and reported the results of the search with a hand movement.
      We distinguished three independent signals: (1) a visual signal describing
      the abrupt onset of a visual stimulus in the receptive field; (2) a
      saccadic signal predicting the monkey's saccadic reaction time
      independently of the nature of the stimulus; (3) a cognitive signal
      distinguishing between the search target and a distractor independently of
      the direction of the impending saccade. The cognitive signal became
      significant on average 27 ms after the saccadic signal but before the
      saccade was made. The three signals summed in a manner discernable at the
      level of the single neuron.

AB  - In the field of psychology, the practice ofp value null-hypothesis testing
      is as widespread as ever. Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of
      it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of
      thep value procedure. In particular,p values are based on data that were
      never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by
      subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical
      evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each
      problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to
      statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to
      thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use
      the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference
      (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian
      hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be
      easily calculated from SPSS output.

AB  - Basing higher-order decisions on expected value (reward probability x
      reward magnitude) maximizes an agent's accruement of reward over time. The
      goal of this study was to determine whether the advanced preparation of
      simple actions reflected the expected value of the potential outcomes.
      Human subjects were required to direct a saccadic eye movement to a visual
      target that was presented either to the left or right of a central
      fixation point on each trial. Expected value was manipulated by adjusting
      the probability of presenting each target and their associated magnitude
      of monetary reward across 15 blocks of trials. We found that saccadic
      reaction times (SRTs) were negatively correlated to the relative expected
      value of the targets. Occasionally, an irrelevant visual distractor was
      presented before the target to probe the spatial allocation of saccadic
      preparation. Distractor-directed errors (oculomotor captures) varied as a
      function of the relative expected value of, and the distance of
      distractors from, the potential valued targets. SRTs and oculomotor
      captures were better correlated to the relative expected value of actions
      than to reward probability, reward magnitude, or overall motivation.
      Together, our results suggest that the level and spatial distribution of
      competitive dynamic neural fields representing saccadic preparation
      reflect the relative expected value of the potential actions.

AB  - Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of
      the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the
      lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting
      functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in
      this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and
      data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which
      the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a
      function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is
      optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to
      provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model,
      the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the
      structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient
      detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users
      who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such
      as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not
      easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.

AB  - A study with low statistical power has a reduced chance of detecting a
      true effect, but it is less well appreciated that low power also reduces
      the likelihood that a statistically significant result reflects a true
      effect. Here, we show that the average statistical power of studies in the
      neurosciences is very low. The consequences of this include overestimates
      of effect size and low reproducibility of results. There are also ethical
      dimensions to this problem, as unreliable research is inefficient and
      wasteful. Improving reproducibility in neuroscience is a key priority and
      requires attention to well-established but often ignored methodological
      principles.

AB  - A free-energy principle has been proposed recently that accounts for
      action, perception and learning. This Review looks at some key brain
      theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical
      (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from
      the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of
      these theories - optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is
      optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected
      reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error,
      expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the
      free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories
      might be unified within a free-energy framework.

AB  - Five important trends have emerged from recent work on computational
      models of focal visual attention that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based
      control of attentional deployment. First, the perceptual saliency of
      stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second, a unique
      'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over
      the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up
      control strategy. Third, inhibition of return, the process by which the
      currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a
      crucial element of attentional deployment. Fourth, attention and eye
      movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect
      to the coordinate system used to control attention. And last, scene
      understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of
      attended locations. Insights from these five key areas provide a framework
      for a computational and neurobiological understanding of visual attention.

AB  - Most models of visual search, whether involving overt eye movements or
      covert shifts of attention, are based on the concept of a saliency map,
      that is, an explicit two-dimensional map that encodes the saliency or
      conspicuity of objects in the visual environment. Competition among
      neurons in this map gives rise to a single winning location that
      corresponds to the next attended target. Inhibiting this location
      automatically allows the system to attend to the next most salient
      location. We describe a detailed computer implementation of such a scheme,
      focusing on the problem of combining information across modalities, here
      orientation, intensity and color information, in a purely stimulus-driven
      manner. The model is applied to common psychophysical stimuli as well as
      to a very demanding visual search task. Its successful performance is used
      to address the extent to which the primate visual system carries out
      visual search via one or more such saliency maps and how this can be
      tested.

AB  - When multiple objects are present in a visual scene, they compete for
      cortical processing in the visual system; selective attention biases this
      competition so that representations of behaviorally relevant objects enter
      awareness and irrelevant objects do not. Deployments of selective
      attention can be voluntary (e.g., shift or attention to a target's
      expected spatial location) or stimulus driven (e.g., capture of attention
      by a target-defining feature such as color). Here we use functional
      magnetic resonance imaging to show that both of these factors induce
      spatially selective attentional modulations within regions of human
      occipital, parietal, and frontal cortex. In addition, the voluntary
      attentional modulations are temporally sustained, indicating that activity
      in these regions dynamically tracks the locus of attention. These data
      show that a convolution of factors, including prior knowledge of location
      and target-defining features, determines the relative competitive
      advantage of visual stimuli within multiple stages of the visual system.

AB  - Our visual system is highly sensitive to regularities in the environment.
      Locations that were important in one's previous experience are often
      prioritized during search, even though observers may not be aware of the
      learning. In this study we characterized the guidance of spatial attention
      by incidental learning of a target's spatial probability, and examined the
      interaction between endogenous cuing and probability cuing. Participants
      searched for a target (T) among distractors (Ls). The target was more
      often located in one region of the screen than in others. We found that
      search reaction time (RT) was faster when the target appeared in the
      high-frequency region rather than the low-frequency regions. This
      difference increased when there were more items on the display, suggesting
      that probability cuing guides spatial attention. Additional data indicated
      that on their own, probability cuing and endogenous cuing (e.g., a central
      arrow that predicted a target's location) were similarly effective at
      guiding attention. However, when both cues were presented at once,
      probability cuing was largely eliminated. Thus, although both incidental
      learning and endogenous cuing can effectively guide attention, endogenous
      cuing takes precedence over incidental learning.

AB  - We investigated the role of spatial probabilities in target location
      during participants' performance of a visual search task. Experiments 1
      and 2 demonstrated that spatial probabilities could serve as a powerful
      attentional bias that produced faster detection of targets in
      high-probability locations than of those in low- or random-probability
      locations. The effect could not be explained by repetition priming alone.
      Moreover, responses to targets in low-probability locations were slowed
      only when a distractor was present in the high-probability location. In
      Experiments 3-5, we compared the effects of spatial probability with an
      explicit endogenous cue and a salient exogenous cue. Facilitation due to
      spatial probability was independent of any benefit afforded by the
      explicit endogenous cue but interacted with the salient exogenous cue,
      such that the exogenous cue validity effect was compressed for targets in
      the high-probability location. Together, these results suggest that the
      spatial probabilities governing target location constitute a potent bias
      of visual processing and, as such, can be considered an attentional cue
      that differs from both typical explicit endogenous and salient exogenous
      cues.

AB  - Spatial priority maps are real-time representations of the behavioral
      salience of locations in the visual field, resulting from the combined
      influence of stimulus driven activity and top-down signals related to the
      current goals of the individual. They arbitrate which of a number of
      (potential) targets in the visual scene will win the competition for
      attentional resources. As a result, deployment of visual attention to a
      specific spatial location is determined by the current peak of activation
      (corresponding to the highest behavioral salience) across the map. Here we
      report a behavioral study performed on healthy human volunteers, where we
      demonstrate that spatial priority maps can be shaped via reward-based
      learning, reflecting long-lasting alterations (biases) in the behavioral
      salience of specific spatial locations. These biases exert an especially
      strong influence on performance under conditions where multiple potential
      targets compete for selection, conferring competitive advantage to targets
      presented in spatial locations associated with greater reward during
      learning relative to targets presented in locations associated with lesser
      reward. Such acquired biases of spatial attention are persistent, are
      nonstrategic in nature, and generalize across stimuli and task contexts.
      These results suggest that reward-based attentional learning can induce
      plastic changes in spatial priority maps, endowing these representations
      with the "intelligent" capacity to learn from experience.

AB  - Response time (RT) is facilitated when a target appears at a cued (valid)
      location versus an uncued (invalid) location. Interestingly, this
      valid-versus-invalid RT difference increases as the percentage of valid
      trials increases. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism
      responsible for this proportion valid cueing effect (PVE). The PVE is
      thought to reflect changes in voluntary attentional allocation, with
      greater attention being committed endogenously to the cued location as the
      percentage of valid trials increases. However, recent research has
      suggested that the PVE may reflect a form of implicit learning between the
      cue and the target location that is developed outside of awareness, and
      that this determines how attention is allocated. This lack of convergence
      may be due to methodological differences in how voluntary processing has
      been inferred. To test this issue, we generated a method that would allow
      the measurement of different degrees of volitional attention. In addition,
      we manipulated whether participants were instructed to attend to the
      cue-target relationship and determined whether this explicit engagement of
      attention influenced the PVE. We found that for both peripheral and
      central cues, volitional control is not required for a PVE; however,
      volitional control can modulate a PVE that is produced by central cues.
      Thus, a PVE is not a reliable indicator of volitional control, but its
      sensitivity to volitional control varies across cues. The present data
      shed light on the mechanism subserving the PVE and lend support to the
      theory that different cues engage, to some degree, qualitatively different
      forms of visuospatial attention.

AB  - Five experiments examine the combined effects of spatial and non-spatial
      cues on the latency of an orientation judgement. In Experiment 1 an
      interaction between position and form expectancies is observed: There is
      an unusual delay in response time (RT) when expectancies mismatch—that is,
      when an unexpected (uncued) form appears at an expected (cued) position or
      an expected (cued) form appears at an unexpected (uncued) position. This
      interaction is inconsistent with the spatial spotlight model's prediction
      that position and form expectancy effects will be additive. The
      position-form interaction is eliminated when target position
      discriminability is made difficult by adding a distractor item at the
      location not containing a target (Experiment 2) or by decreasing the
      validity of the positional cue (Experiment 3). Decreasing the validity of
      the form cue has no effect on the interaction. The mismatching expectancy
      interaction is not unique to combinations of position and form—it is also
      observed when temporal (Experiment 4) and colour (Experiment 5)
      expectancies are combined with form expectancies. The effects of advance
      knowledge of position therefore suggest no special status for location
      compared to other stimulus attributes. Thus, at least for combined
      expectancies, the notion of a uniquely spatial mental spotlight seems
      unjustified. It is hypothesized that expectancy interactions may reflect a
      hierarchical crosstalk relation between dimensions of encoding.

AB  - This review focuses on covert attention and how it alters early vision. I
      explain why attention is considered a selective process, the constructs of
      covert attention, spatial endogenous and exogenous attention, and
      feature-based attention. I explain how in the last 25 years research on
      attention has characterized the effects of covert attention on spatial
      filters and how attention influences the selection of stimuli of interest.
      This review includes the effects of spatial attention on discriminability
      and appearance in tasks mediated by contrast sensitivity and spatial
      resolution; the effects of feature-based attention on basic visual
      processes, and a comparison of the effects of spatial and feature-based
      attention. The emphasis of this review is on psychophysical studies, but
      relevant electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies and models
      regarding how and where neuronal responses are modulated are also
      discussed.

AB  - The basal ganglia network serves to integrate information about context,
      actions, and outcomes to shape the behavior of an animal based on its past
      experience. Clinically, the basal ganglia receive the most attention for
      their role in movement disorders. Recent advances in technology have
      opened new avenues of research into the structure and function of basal
      ganglia circuits. One emerging theme is the importance of GABAergic
      interneurons in coordinating and regulating network function. Here, we
      discuss evidence that changes in striatal GABAergic microcircuits
      contribute to basal ganglia dysfunction in several movement disorders.
      Because interneurons are genetically and neurochemically unique from
      striatal projection neurons, they may provide promising therapeutic
      targets for the treatment of a variety of striatal-based disorders.

AB  - Reward prediction errors consist of the differences between received and
      predicted rewards. They are crucial for basic forms of learning about
      rewards and make us strive for more rewards-an evolutionary beneficial
      trait. Most dopamine neurons in the midbrain of humans, monkeys, and
      rodents signal a reward prediction error; they are activated by more
      reward than predicted (positive prediction error), remain at baseline
      activity for fully predicted rewards, and show depressed activity with
      less reward than predicted (negative prediction error). The dopamine
      signal increases nonlinearly with reward value and codes formal economic
      utility. Drugs of addiction generate, hijack, and amplify the dopamine
      reward signal and induce exaggerated, uncontrolled dopamine effects on
      neuronal plasticity. The striatum, amygdala, and frontal cortex also show
      reward prediction error coding, but only in subpopulations of neurons.
      Thus, the important concept of reward prediction errors is implemented in
      neuronal hardware.

AB  - Behavioral studies suggest that making a decision involves representing
      the overall desirability of all available actions and then selecting that
      action that is most desirable. Physiological studies have proposed that
      neurons in the parietal cortex play a role in selecting movements for
      execution. To test the hypothesis that these parietal neurons encode the
      subjective desirability of making particular movements, we exploited
      Nash's game theoretic equilibrium, during which the subjective
      desirability of multiple actions should be equal for human players.
      Behavior measured during a strategic game suggests that monkeys' choices,
      like those of humans, are guided by subjective desirability. Under these
      conditions, activity in the parietal cortex was correlated with the
      relative subjective desirability of actions irrespective of the specific
      combination of reward magnitude, reward probability, and response
      probability associated with each action. These observations may help place
      many recent findings regarding the posterior parietal cortex into a common
      conceptual framework.

AB  - Test targets ('singletons') that displayed orientation, motion, luminance,
      or color contrast, or pairwise combinations of these, were presented in
      line texture arrays, and their saliences were quantified in comparison to
      reference targets at defined luminance levels. In general, saliency
      effects in different stimulus dimensions did add, but did not add
      linearly. That is, targets with feature contrast in two dimensions were
      generally more salient than targets with only one of these properties, but
      often less salient than predicted from the sum of the individual saliency
      components. Salience variations within a dimension were compared with and
      without a second saliency effect added. The resulting gain reduction in
      the combined stimulus conditions was interpreted to reflect the amount of
      overlap between the respective saliency mechanisms. Combinations of
      orientation and color contrast produced the strongest gain reduction
      (about 90% for color in orientation) thus indicating the strongest overlap
      of underlying saliency mechanisms. Combinations of orientation and motion
      contrast revealed about 50% overlap, slightly smaller rates were found for
      combinations of color and motion. All combinations with luminance contrast
      (orientation and luminance, motion and luminance) produced only little
      gain reduction (<30%) thus indicating a higher degree of independence
      between the underlying saliency mechanisms than for other stimulus
      dimensions.

AB  - Historically, the psychophysical evidence for "selective attention"
      originated mainly from visual search experiments. A first important
      distinction in the processing of information in visual search tasks is its
      separation in two stages. The first, early "preattentive" stage operates
      in parallel across the entire visual field extracting single "primitive
      features" without integrating them. The second "attentive" stage
      corresponds to the specialized integration of information from a limited
      part of the field at any one time, i.e. serially. So far, models based on
      the above mentioned two-stage processes have been able to distinguish
      features from conjunction search conditions based on the observed slopes
      of the linear relation between reaction time (i.e., search time) and the
      number of items in the stimulus array. We propose a neuroscience based
      model for visual attention that works across the visual field in parallel,
      but due to its intrinsic dynamics can show the two experimentally observed
      modes of visual attention, namely: the serial focal attention and the
      parallel spread of attention over space. The model demonstrates that
      neither explicit serial focal search nor saliency maps need to be assumed.
      In the present model the focus of attention is not included in the system
      but only emerges after convergence of the dynamical behaviour of the
      neural networks. Furthermore, existing models have not been able to
      explain the variation of slopes observed in different kinds of conjunction
      search modes. We hypothesize that the different slopes can be explained by
      assuming that selective attention is guided by an independent mechanism
      which corresponds to the independent search for each feature. The model
      consistently integrates the different neuroscience levels by considering
      the microscopic neurodynamical mechanism that underlies visual attention,
      the different brain areas of the dorsal or "where" and ventral or "what"
      paths of the visual cortex, and behavioural data.

AB  - We describe a model of invariant visual object recognition in the brain
      that incorporates feedback biasing effects of top-down attentional
      mechanisms on a hierarchically organized set of visual cortical areas with
      convergent forward connectivity, reciprocal feedback connections, and
      local intra-area competition. The model displays space-based and
      object-based covert visual search by using attentional top-down feedback
      from either the posterior parietal or the inferior temporal cortex (IT)
      modules, and interactions between the two processing streams occurring in
      V1 and V2. The model explains the gradually increasing magnitude of the
      attentional modulation that is found in fMRI experiments from earlier
      visual areas (V1, V2) to higher ventral stream visual areas (V4, IT); how
      the effective size of the receptive fields of IT neurons becomes smaller
      in natural cluttered scenes; and makes predictions about interactions
      between stimuli in their receptive fields.

AB  - In an uncertain environment, probabilities are key to predicting future
      events and making adaptive choices. However, little is known about how
      humans learn such probabilities and where and how they are encoded in the
      brain, especially when they concern more than two outcomes. During
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), young adults learned the
      probabilities of uncertain stimuli through repetitive sampling. Stimuli
      represented payoffs and participants had to predict their occurrence to
      maximize their earnings. Choices indicated loss and risk aversion but
      unbiased estimation of probabilities. BOLD response in medial prefrontal
      cortex and angular gyri increased linearly with the probability of the
      currently observed stimulus, untainted by its value. Connectivity analyses
      during rest and task revealed that these regions belonged to the default
      mode network. The activation of past outcomes in memory is evoked as a
      possible mechanism to explain the engagement of the default mode network
      in probability learning. A BOLD response relating to value was detected
      only at decision time, mainly in striatum. It is concluded that activity
      in inferior parietal and medial prefrontal cortex reflects the amount of
      evidence accumulated in favor of competing and uncertain outcomes.

AB  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and surface-based
      representations of brain activity were used to compare the functional
      anatomy of two tasks, one involving covert shifts of attention to
      peripheral visual stimuli, the other involving both attentional and
      saccadic shifts to the same stimuli. Overlapping regional networks in
      parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes were active in both tasks. This
      anatomical overlap is consistent with the hypothesis that attentional and
      oculomotor processes are tightly integrated at the neural level.

AB  - The mathematical formulations used to study the neurophysiological signals
      governing choice behavior fall under one of two major theoretical
      frameworks: "choice probability" or "subjective value." These two
      formulations represent behavioral quantities closely tied to the decision
      process, but it is unknown whether one of these variables, or both,
      dominates the neural mechanisms that mediate choice. Value and choice
      probability are difficult to distinguish in practice, because
      higher-valued options are chosen more frequently in free-choice tasks.
      This distinction is particularly relevant for sensorimotor areas such as
      parietal cortex, where both value information and motor signals related to
      choice have been observed. We recorded the activity of neurons in the
      lateral intraparietal area while monkeys performed an intertemporal choice
      task for rewards differing in delay to reinforcement. Here we show that
      the activity of parietal neurons is precisely correlated with the
      individual-specific discounted value of delayed rewards, with peak
      subjective value modulation occurring early in task trials. In contrast,
      late in the decision process these same neurons transition to encode the
      selected action. When directly compared, the strong delay-related
      modulation early during decision making is driven by subjective value
      rather than the monkey's probability of choice. These findings show that
      in addition to information about gains, parietal cortex also incorporates
      information about delay into a precise physiological correlate of economic
      value functions, independent of the probability of choice.

AB  - This study documented the relative strength of task goals, visual
      statistical learning, and monetary reward in guiding spatial attention.
      Using a difficult T-among-L search task, we cued spatial attention to one
      visual quadrant by (i) instructing people to prioritize it (goal-driven
      attention), (ii) placing the target frequently there (location probability
      learning), or (iii) associating that quadrant with greater monetary gain
      (reward-based attention). Results showed that successful goal-driven
      attention exerted the strongest influence on search RT. Incidental
      location probability learning yielded a smaller though still robust
      effect. Incidental reward learning produced negligible guidance for
      spatial attention. The 95 % confidence intervals of the three effects were
      largely nonoverlapping. To understand these results, we simulated the role
      of location repetition priming in probability cuing and reward learning.
      Repetition priming underestimated the strength of location probability
      cuing, suggesting that probability cuing involved long-term statistical
      learning of how to shift attention. Repetition priming provided a
      reasonable account for the negligible effect of reward on spatial
      attention. We propose a multiple-systems view of spatial attention that
      includes task goals, search habit, and priming as primary drivers of
      top-down attention.

      the effects of target-defining task-relevant and task-irrelevant features
      interact to modulate visual selection; the other predicts that visual
      selection is determined by the independent combination of relevant and
      irrelevant feature effects. These alternatives were tested using a visual
      search task that contained multiple targets, placing a high demand on the
      need for selectivity, and that was data-limited and required unspeeded
      responses, emphasizing early perceptual selection processes. One week
      prior to the visual search task, participants completed a training task in
      which they learned to associate particular colors with a specific reward
      value. In the search task, the reward-associated colors were presented
      surrounding targets and distractors, but were neither physically salient
      nor task-relevant. In two experiments, the irrelevant reward-associated
      features influenced performance, but only when they were presented in a
      task-relevant location. The costs induced by the irrelevant
      reward-associated features were greater when they oriented attention to a
      target than to a distractor. In a third experiment, we examined the
      effects of selection history in the absence of reward history and found
      that the interaction between task relevance and selection history
      differed, relative to when the features had previously been associated
      with reward. The results indicate that under conditions that demand highly
      efficient perceptual selection, physically nonsalient task-irrelevant and
      task-relevant factors interact to influence visual selective attention.

AB  - Recent research reported that task-irrelevant colors captured attention if
      these colors previously served as search targets and received high
      monetary reward. We showed that both monetary reward and value-independent
      mechanisms influenced selective attention. Participants searched for two
      potential target colors among distractor colors in the training phase.
      Subsequently, they searched for a shape singleton in a testing phase.
      Experiment 1 found that participants were slower in the testing phase if a
      distractor of a previous target color was present rather than absent. Such
      slowing was observed even when no monetary reward was used during
      training. Experiment 2 associated monetary rewards with the target colors
      during the training phase. Participants were faster finding the target
      associated with higher monetary reward. However, reward training did not
      yield value-dependent attentional capture in the testing phase.
      Attentional capture by the previous target colors was not significantly
      greater for the previously high-reward color than the previously low or
      no-reward color. These findings revealed both the power and limitations of
      monetary reward on attention. Although monetary reward can increase
      attentional priority for the high-reward target during training,
      subsequent attentional capture effects may not be reward-based, but
      reflect, in part, attentional capture by previous targets.

AB  - In this article, we present a Bayes factor solution for inference in
      multiple regression. Bayes factors are principled measures of the relative
      evidence from data for various models or positions, including models that
      embed null hypotheses. In this regard, they may be used to state positive
      evidence for a lack of an effect, which is not possible in conventional
      significance testing. One obstacle to the adoption of Bayes factor in
      psychological science is a lack of guidance and software. Recently, Liang,
      Paulo, Molina, Clyde, and Berger (2008) developed computationally
      attractive default Bayes factors for multiple regression designs. We
      provide a web applet for convenient computation and guidance and context
      for use of these priors. We discuss the interpretation and advantages of
      the advocated Bayes factor evidence measures.

AB  - Predicting future reward is paramount to performing an optimal action.
      Although a number of brain areas are known to encode such predictions, a
      detailed account of how the associated representations evolve over time is
      lacking. Here, we address this question using human magnetoencephalography
      (MEG) and multivariate analyses of instantaneous activity in reconstructed
      sources. We overtrained participants on a simple instrumental reward
      learning task where geometric cues predicted a distribution of possible
      rewards, from which a sample was revealed 2000 ms later. We show that
      predicted mean reward (i.e., expected value), and predicted reward
      variability (i.e., economic risk), are encoded distinctly. Early on,
      representations of mean reward are seen in parietal and visual areas, and
      later in frontal regions with orbitofrontal cortex emerging last.
      Strikingly, an encoding of reward variability emerges simultaneously in
      parietal/sensory and frontal sources and later than mean reward encoding.
      An orbitofrontal variability encoding emerged around the same time as that
      seen for mean reward. Crucially, cross-prediction showed that mean reward
      and variability representations are distinct and also revealed that
      instantaneous representations become more stable over time. Across
      sources, the best fitting metric for variability signals was coefficient
      of variation (rather than SD or variance), but distinct best metrics were
      seen for individual brain regions. Our data demonstrate how a dynamic
      encoding of probabilistic reward prediction unfolds in the brain both in
      time and space.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Predicting future reward is
      paramount to optimal behavior. To gain insight into the underlying neural
      computations, we investigate how reward representations in the brain arise
      over time. Using magnetoencephalography, we show that a representation of
      predicted mean reward emerges early in parietal/sensory regions and later
      in frontal cortex. In contrast, predicted reward variability
      representations appear in most regions at the same time, and slightly
      later than for mean reward. For both features, representations dynamically
      change >1000 ms before stabilizing. The best metric for encoding
      variability is coefficient of variation, with heterogeneity in this
      encoding seen between brain areas. The results provide novel insights into
      the emergence of predictive reward representations.

AB  - In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed
      a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific
      theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is
      the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on
      the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian
      hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention
      has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In
      this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the
      context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology,
      sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From
      Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to
      evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer
      a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors
      provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of
      evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not
      require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available
      for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are
      easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize
      likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion
      (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor,
      which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior
      distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes
      factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so
      that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account
      of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that
      allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models
      initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding
      an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to
      assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.

AB  - The question of which strategy is employed in human decision making has
      been studied extensively in the context of cognitive tasks; however, this
      question has not been investigated systematically in the context of
      perceptual tasks. The goal of this study was to gain insight into the
      decision-making strategy used by human observers in a low-level perceptual
      task. Data from more than 100 individuals who participated in an
      auditory-visual spatial localization task was evaluated to examine which
      of three plausible strategies could account for each observer's behavior
      the best. This task is very suitable for exploring this question because
      it involves an implicit inference about whether the auditory and visual
      stimuli were caused by the same object or independent objects, and
      provides different strategies of how using the inference about causes can
      lead to distinctly different spatial estimates and response patterns. For
      example, employing the commonly used cost function of minimizing the mean
      squared error of spatial estimates would result in a weighted averaging of
      estimates corresponding to different causal structures. A strategy that
      would minimize the error in the inferred causal structure would result in
      the selection of the most likely causal structure and sticking with it in
      the subsequent inference of location-"model selection." A third strategy
      is one that selects a causal structure in proportion to its probability,
      thus attempting to match the probability of the inferred causal structure.
      This type of probability matching strategy has been reported to be used by
      participants predominantly in cognitive tasks. Comparing these three
      strategies, the behavior of the vast majority of observers in this
      perceptual task was most consistent with probability matching. While this
      appears to be a suboptimal strategy and hence a surprising choice for the
      perceptual system to adopt, we discuss potential advantages of such a
      strategy for perception.

AB  - The present study reports four pairs of experiments that examined the role
      of nonpredictive (i.e., task-irrelevant) symbolic stimuli on attentional
      orienting. The experiments involved a simple detection task, an inhibition
      of return (IOR) task, and choice decision tasks both with and without
      attentional bias. Each pair of experiments included one experiment in
      which nonpredictive arrows were presented at the central fixation location
      and another experiment in which nonpredictive direction words (e.g., "up,"
      "down," "left," "right") were presented. The nonpredictive symbolic
      stimuli affected responses in all experiments, with the words producing
      greater effects in the detection task and the arrows producing greater
      effects in the IOR and choice decision tasks. Overall, the present
      findings indicate that there is a strong connection between the
      overlearned representations of the meaning of communicative symbols and
      the reflexive orienting of visual attention.

AB  - For decisions made under time pressure, effective decision making based on
      uncertain or ambiguous evidence requires efficient accumulation of
      evidence over time, as well as appropriately balancing speed and accuracy,
      known as the speed/accuracy trade-off. For simple unimodal stimuli,
      previous studies have shown that human subjects set their speed/accuracy
      trade-off to maximize reward rate. We extend this analysis to situations
      in which information is provided by multiple sensory modalities. Analyzing
      previously collected data (Drugowitsch et al., 2014), we show that human
      subjects adjust their speed/accuracy trade-off to produce near-optimal
      reward rates. This trade-off can change rapidly across trials according to
      the sensory modalities involved, suggesting that it is represented by
      neural population codes rather than implemented by slow neuronal
      mechanisms such as gradual changes in synaptic weights. Furthermore, we
      show that deviations from the optimal speed/accuracy trade-off can be
      explained by assuming an incomplete gradient-based learning of these
      trade-offs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Experience can alter how objects are represented in the visual
      cortex. But experience can take different forms. It is unknown whether the
      kind of visual experience systematically alters the nature of visual
      cortical object representations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We take
      advantage of different training regimens found to produce qualitatively
      different types of perceptual expertise behaviorally in order to contrast
      the neural changes that follow different kinds of visual experience with
      the same objects. Two groups of participants went through training
      regimens that required either subordinate-level individuation or
      basic-level categorization of a set of novel, artificial objects, called
      "Ziggerins". fMRI activity of a region in the right fusiform gyrus
      increased after individuation training and was correlated with the
      magnitude of configural processing of the Ziggerins observed behaviorally.
      In contrast, categorization training caused distributed changes, with
      increased activity in the medial portion of the ventral occipito-temporal
      cortex relative to more lateral areas. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our
      results demonstrate that the kind of experience with a category of objects
      can systematically influence how those objects are represented in visual
      cortex. The demands of prior learning experience therefore appear to be
      one factor determining the organization of activity patterns in visual
      cortex.

AB  - The degree of confidence in a decision provides a graded and probabilistic
      assessment of expected outcome. Although neural mechanisms of perceptual
      decisions have been studied extensively in primates, little is known about
      the mechanisms underlying choice certainty. We have shown that the same
      neurons that represent formation of a decision encode certainty about the
      decision. Rhesus monkeys made decisions about the direction of moving
      random dots, spanning a range of difficulties. They were rewarded for
      correct decisions. On some trials, after viewing the stimulus, the monkeys
      could opt out of the direction decision for a small but certain reward.
      Monkeys exercised this option in a manner that revealed their degree of
      certainty. Neurons in parietal cortex represented formation of the
      direction decision and the degree of certainty underlying the decision to
      opt out.

AB  - A core component of cognitive control - the ability to regulate thoughts
      and actions in accordance with internally represented behavioral goals -
      might be its intrinsic variability. In this article, I describe the dual
      mechanisms of control (DMC) framework, which postulates that this
      variability might arise from qualitative distinctions in temporal dynamics
      between proactive and reactive modes of control. Proactive control
      reflects the sustained and anticipatory maintenance of goal-relevant
      information within lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) to enable optimal
      cognitive performance, whereas reactive control reflects transient
      stimulus-driven goal reactivation that recruits lateral PFC (plus a wider
      brain network) based on interference demands or episodic associations. I
      summarize recent research that demonstrates how the DMC framework provides
      a coherent explanation of three sources of cognitive control variation -
      intra-individual, inter-individual and between-groups - in terms of
      proactive versus reactive control biases.

AB  - During social interactions, people's eyes convey a wealth of information
      about their direction of attention and their emotional and mental states.
      This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of past and current
      research into the perception of gaze behavior and its effect on the
      observer. This encompasses the perception of gaze direction and its
      influence on perception of the other person, as well as gaze-following
      behavior such as joint attention, in infant, adult, and clinical
      populations. Particular focus is given to the gaze-cueing paradigm that
      has been used to investigate the mechanisms of joint attention. The
      contribution of this paradigm has been significant and will likely
      continue to advance knowledge across diverse fields within psychology and
      neuroscience.

AB  - Visual cognition is limited by computational capacity, because the brain
      can process only a fraction of the visual sensorium in detail, and by the
      inherent ambiguity of the information entering the visual system. Two
      mechanisms mitigate these burdens: attention prioritizes stimulus
      processing on the basis of motivational relevance, and expectations
      constrain visual interpretation on the basis of prior likelihood. Of the
      two, attention has been extensively investigated while expectation has
      been relatively neglected. Here, we review recent work that has begun to
      delineate a neurobiology of visual expectation, and contrast the findings
      with those of the attention literature, to explore how these two central
      influences on visual perception overlap, differ and interact.

AB  - Intelligent animals devote much time and energy to exploring and obtaining
      information, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We
      review recent developments on this topic that have emerged from the
      traditionally separate fields of machine learning, eye movements in
      natural behavior, and studies of curiosity in psychology and neuroscience.
      These studies show that exploration may be guided by a family of
      mechanisms that range from automatic biases toward novelty or surprise to
      systematic searches for learning progress and information gain in
      curiosity-driven behavior. In addition, eye movements reflect visual
      information searching in multiple conditions and are amenable for
      cellular-level investigations. This suggests that the oculomotor system is
      an excellent model system for understanding information-sampling
      mechanisms.

AB  - When subjects monitor a single location, visual target detection depends
      on the pre-target phase of an ∼8 Hz brain rhythm. When multiple locations
      are monitored, performance decrements suggest a division of the 8 Hz
      rhythm over the number of locations, indicating that different locations
      are sequentially sampled. Indeed, when subjects monitor two locations,
      performance benefits alternate at a 4 Hz rhythm. These performance
      alternations were revealed after a reset of attention to one location.
      Although resets are common and important events for attention, it is
      unknown whether, in the absence of resets, ongoing attention samples
      stimuli in alternation. Here, we examined whether spatially specific
      attentional sampling can be revealed by ongoing pre-target brain rhythms.
      Visually induced gamma-band activity plays a role in spatial attention.
      Therefore, we hypothesized that performance on two simultaneously
      monitored stimuli can be predicted by a 4 Hz modulation of gamma-band
      activity. Brain rhythms were assessed with magnetoencephalography (MEG)
      while subjects monitored bilateral grating stimuli for a unilateral target
      event. The corresponding contralateral gamma-band responses were
      subtracted from each other to isolate spatially selective, target-related
      fluctuations. The resulting lateralized gamma-band activity (LGA) showed
      opposite pre-target 4 Hz phases for detected versus missed targets. The 4
      Hz phase of pre-target LGA accounted for a 14.5% modulation in
      performance. These findings suggest that spatial attention is a
      theta-rhythmic sampling process that is continuously ongoing, with each
      sampling cycle being implemented through gamma-band synchrony.

AB  - Over a century of scientific work has focused on defining the factors
      motivating behavioral learning. Observations in animals and humans trained
      on a wide range of tasks support reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms as
      accounting for the learning. Still unknown, however, are the signals that
      drive learning in naive, untrained subjects. Here, we capitalized on a
      sequential saccade task in which macaque monkeys acquired repetitive
      scanning sequences without instruction. We found that spike activity in
      the caudate nucleus after each trial corresponded to an integrated
      cost-benefit signal that was highly correlated with the degree of
      naturalistic untutored learning by the monkeys. Across learning, neurons
      encoding both cost and outcome gradually acquired increasingly sharp
      phasic trial-end responses that paralleled the development of the
      habit-like, repetitive saccade sequences. Our findings demonstrate an
      integrated cost-benefit signal by which RL and its neural correlates could
      drive naturalistic behaviors in freely behaving primates.

AB  - Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) or brain decoding methods have become
      standard practice in analysing fMRI data. Although decoding methods have
      been extensively applied in Brain Computing Interfaces (BCI), these
      methods have only recently been applied to time-series neuroimaging data
      such as MEG and EEG to address experimental questions in Cognitive
      Neuroscience. In a tutorial-style review, we describe a broad set of
      options to inform future time-series decoding studies from a Cognitive
      Neuroscience perspective. Using example MEG data, we illustrate the
      effects that different options in the decoding analysis pipeline can have
      on experimental results where the aim is to 'decode' different perceptual
      stimuli or cognitive states over time from dynamic brain activation
      patterns. We show that decisions made at both preprocessing (e.g.,
      dimensionality reduction, subsampling, trial averaging) and decoding
      (e.g., classifier selection, cross-validation design) stages of the
      analysis can significantly affect the results. In addition to standard
      decoding, we describe extensions to MVPA for time-varying neuroimaging
      data including representational similarity analysis, temporal
      generalisation, and the interpretation of classifier weight maps. Finally,
      we outline important caveats in the design and interpretation of
      time-series decoding experiments.

AB  - Dopamine has a central role in motivation and reward. Dopaminergic neurons
      in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) signal the discrepancy between
      expected and actual rewards (that is, reward prediction error), but how
      they compute such signals is unknown. We recorded the activity of VTA
      neurons while mice associated different odour cues with appetitive and
      aversive outcomes. We found three types of neuron based on responses to
      odours and outcomes: approximately half of the neurons (type I, 52%)
      showed phasic excitation after reward-predicting odours and rewards in a
      manner consistent with reward prediction error coding; the other half of
      neurons showed persistent activity during the delay between odour and
      outcome that was modulated positively (type II, 31%) or negatively (type
      III, 18%) by the value of outcomes. Whereas the activity of type I neurons
      was sensitive to actual outcomes (that is, when the reward was delivered
      as expected compared to when it was unexpectedly omitted), the activity of
      type II and type III neurons was determined predominantly by
      reward-predicting odours. We 'tagged' dopaminergic and GABAergic neurons
      with the light-sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 and identified them
      based on their responses to optical stimulation while recording. All
      identified dopaminergic neurons were of type I and all GABAergic neurons
      were of type II. These results show that VTA GABAergic neurons signal
      expected reward, a key variable for dopaminergic neurons to calculate
      reward prediction error.

AB  - In the current theory of learning, the reward prediction error (RPE), the
      difference between expected and received reward, is thought to be a key
      factor in reward-based learning, working as a teaching signal. The
      activity of dopamine neurons is known to code RPE, and the release of
      dopamine is known to modify the strength of synaptic connectivity in the
      target neurons. A fundamental interest in current neuroscience concerns
      the origin of RPE signals in the brain. Here, we show that a group of rat
      striatal neurons show a clear parametric RPE coding similar to that of
      dopamine neurons when tested under probabilistic pavlovian conditioning.
      Together with the fact that striatum and dopamine neurons have strong
      direct and indirect fiber connections, the result suggests that the
      striatum plays an important role in coding RPE signal by cooperating with
      dopamine neurons.

AB  - The brain is limited in its capacity to consciously process information,
      necessitating gating of information. While conscious perception is
      robustly associated with sustained, recurrent interactions between
      widespread cortical regions, subcortical regions, including the striatum,
      influence cortical activity. Here, we examined whether the ventral
      striatum, given its ability to modulate cortical information flow,
      contributes to conscious perception. Using intracranial EEG, we recorded
      ventral striatum activity while 7 patients performed an attentional blink
      task in which they had to detect two targets (T1 and T2) in a stream of
      distractors. Typically, when T2 follows T1 within 100-500 ms, it is often
      not perceived (i.e., the attentional blink). We found that conscious T2
      perception was influenced and signaled by ventral striatal activity.
      Specifically, the failure to perceive T2 was foreshadowed by a T1-induced
      increase in α and low β oscillatory activity as early as 80 ms after T1,
      indicating that the attentional blink to T2 may be due to very early
      T1-driven attentional capture. Moreover, only consciously perceived
      targets were associated with an increase in θ activity between 200 and 400
      ms. These unique findings shed new light on the mechanisms that give rise
      to the attentional blink by revealing that conscious target perception may
      be determined by T1 processing at a much earlier processing stage than
      traditionally believed. More generally, they indicate that ventral
      striatum activity may contribute to conscious perception, presumably by
      gating cortical information flow. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: What determines
      whether we become aware of a piece of information or not? Conscious access
      has been robustly associated with activity within a distributed network of
      cortical regions. Using intracranial electrophysiological recordings
      during an attentional blink task, we tested the idea that the ventral
      striatum, because of its ability to modulate cortical information flow,
      may contribute to conscious perception. We find that conscious perception
      is influenced and signaled by ventral striatal activity. Short-latency
      (80-140 ms) striatal responses to a first target determined conscious
      perception of a second target. Moreover, conscious perception of the
      second target was signaled by longer-latency (200-400 ms) striatal
      activity. These results suggest that the ventral striatum may be part of a
      subcortical network that influences conscious experience.

AB  - In order to understand the working brain as a network, it is essential to
      identify the mechanisms by which information is gated between regions. We
      here propose that information is gated by inhibiting task-irrelevant
      regions, thus routing information to task-relevant regions. The functional
      inhibition is reflected in oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13
      Hz). From a physiological perspective the alpha activity provides pulsed
      inhibition reducing the processing capabilities of a given area. Active
      processing in the engaged areas is reflected by neuronal synchronization
      in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) accompanied by an alpha band decrease.
      According to this framework the brain could be studied as a network by
      investigating cross-frequency interactions between gamma and alpha
      activity. Specifically the framework predicts that optimal task
      performance will correlate with alpha activity in task-irrelevant areas.
      In this review we will discuss the empirical support for this framework.
      Given that alpha activity is by far the strongest signal recorded by EEG
      and MEG, we propose that a major part of the electrophysiological activity
      detected from the working brain reflects gating by inhibition.

AB  - Although the resting and baseline states of the human electroencephalogram
      and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) are dominated by oscillations in the alpha
      band (approximately 10 Hz), the functional role of these oscillations
      remains unclear. In this study we used MEG to investigate how spontaneous
      oscillations in humans presented before visual stimuli modulate visual
      perception. Subjects had to report if there was a subtle difference in
      gray levels between two superimposed presented discs. We then compared the
      prestimulus brain activity for correctly (hits) versus incorrectly
      (misses) identified stimuli. We found that visual discrimination ability
      decreased with an increase in prestimulus alpha power. Given that reaction
      times did not vary systematically with prestimulus alpha power changes in
      vigilance are not likely to explain the change in discrimination ability.
      Source reconstruction using spatial filters allowed us to identify the
      brain areas accounting for this effect. The dominant sources modulating
      visual perception were localized around the parieto-occipital sulcus. We
      suggest that the parieto-occipital alpha power reflects functional
      inhibition imposed by higher level areas, which serves to modulate the
      gain of the visual stream.

AB  - The role of the thalamus in high-level cognition-attention, working memory
      (WM), rule-based learning, and decision making-remains poorly understood,
      especially in comparison to that of cortical frontoparietal networks
      [1-3]. Studies of visual thalamus have revealed important roles for
      pulvinar and lateral geniculate nucleus in visuospatial perception and
      attention [4-10] and for mediodorsal thalamus in oculomotor control [11].
      Ventrolateral thalamus contains subdivisions devoted to action control as
      part of a circuit involving the basal ganglia [12, 13] and motor,
      premotor, and prefrontal cortices [14], whereas anterior thalamus forms a
      memory network in connection with the hippocampus [15]. This connectivity
      profile suggests that ventrolateral and anterior thalamus may represent a
      nexus between mnemonic and control functions, such as action or
      attentional selection. Here, we characterize the role of thalamus in the
      interplay between memory and visual attention. We show that ventrolateral
      lesions impair the influence of WM representations on attentional
      deployment. A subsequent fMRI study in healthy volunteers demonstrates
      involvement of ventrolateral and, notably, anterior thalamus in biasing
      attention through WM contents. To further characterize the memory types
      used by the thalamus to bias attention, we performed a second fMRI study
      that involved learning of stimulus-stimulus associations and their
      retrieval from long-term memory to optimize attention in search. Responses
      in ventrolateral and anterior thalamic nuclei tracked learning of the
      predictiveness of these abstract associations and their use in directing
      attention. These findings demonstrate a key role for human thalamus in
      higher-level cognition, notably, in mnemonic biasing of attention.

AB  - How similar are the eye movement patterns of different subjects when free
      viewing dynamic natural scenes? We collected a large database of eye
      movements from 54 subjects on 18 high-resolution videos of outdoor scenes
      and measured their variability using the Normalized Scanpath Saliency,
      which we extended to the temporal domain. Even though up to about 80% of
      subjects looked at the same image region in some video parts, variability
      usually was much greater. Eye movements on natural movies were then
      compared with eye movements in several control conditions. "Stop-motion"
      movies had almost identical semantic content as the original videos but
      lacked continuous motion. Hollywood action movie trailers were used to
      probe the upper limit of eye movement coherence that can be achieved by
      deliberate camera work, scene cuts, etc. In a "repetitive" condition,
      subjects viewed the same movies ten times each over the course of 2 days.
      Results show several systematic differences between conditions both for
      general eye movement parameters such as saccade amplitude and fixation
      duration and for eye movement variability. Most importantly, eye movements
      on static images are initially driven by stimulus onset effects and later,
      more so than on continuous videos, by subject-specific idiosyncrasies; eye
      movements on Hollywood movies are significantly more coherent than those
      on natural movies. We conclude that the stimuli types often used in
      laboratory experiments, static images and professionally cut material, are
      not very representative of natural viewing behavior. All stimuli and gaze
      data are publicly available at

AB  - Reward learning gives rise to strong attentional biases. Stimuli
      previously associated with reward automatically capture visual attention
      regardless of intention. Dopamine signaling within the ventral striatum
      plays an important role in reward learning, representing the expected
      reward initiated by a cue. How dopamine and the striatum may be involved
      in maintaining behaviors that have been shaped by reward learning, even
      after reward expectancies have changed, is less well understood.
      Nonspecific measures of brain activity have implicated the striatum in
      value-based attention. However, the neurochemical mechanisms underlying
      the attentional priority of learned reward cues remain unexplored. Here,
      we investigated the contribution of dopamine to value-based attention
      using positron emission tomography (PET) with [(11)C]raclopride. We show
      that, in the explicit absence of reward, the magnitude of attentional
      capture by previously reward-associated but currently task-irrelevant
      distractors is correlated across individuals with changes in available
      D2/D3 dopamine receptors (presumably due to intrasynaptic dopamine) linked
      to distractor processing within the right caudate and posterior putamen.
      Our findings provide direct evidence linking dopamine signaling within the
      striatum to the involuntary orienting of attention, and specifically to
      the attention-grabbing quality of learned reward cues. These findings also
      shed light on the neurochemical basis of individual susceptibility to
      value-driven attentional capture, which is known to play a role in
      addiction. More broadly, the present study highlights the value and
      feasibility of using PET to relate changes in the release of a
      neurotransmitter to learning-dependent changes in healthy adults.

AB  - We have suggested that the mirror-neuron system might be usefully
      understood as implementing Bayes-optimal perception of actions emitted by
      oneself or others. To substantiate this claim, we present neuronal
      simulations that show the same representations can prescribe motor
      behavior and encode motor intentions during action-observation. These
      simulations are based on the free-energy formulation of active inference,
      which is formally related to predictive coding. In this scheme,
      (generalised) states of the world are represented as trajectories. When
      these states include motor trajectories they implicitly entail intentions
      (future motor states). Optimizing the representation of these intentions
      enables predictive coding in a prospective sense. Crucially, the same
      generative models used to make predictions can be deployed to predict the
      actions of self or others by simply changing the bias or precision (i.e.
      attention) afforded to proprioceptive signals. We illustrate these points
      using simulations of handwriting to illustrate neuronally plausible
      generation and recognition of itinerant (wandering) motor trajectories. We
      then use the same simulations to produce synthetic electrophysiological
      responses to violations of intentional expectations. Our results affirm
      that a Bayes-optimal approach provides a principled framework, which
      accommodates current thinking about the mirror-neuron system. Furthermore,
      it endorses the general formulation of action as active inference.

AB  - We constantly look for patterns in the environment that allow us to learn
      its key regularities. These regularities are fundamental in enabling us to
      make predictions about what is likely to happen next. The physiological
      study of regularity extraction has focused primarily on repetitive
      sequence-based rules within the sensory environment, or on
      stimulus-outcome associations in the context of reward-based
      decision-making. Here we ask whether we implicitly encode non-sequential
      stochastic regularities, and detect violations therein. We addressed this
      question using a novel experimental design and both behavioural and
      magnetoencephalographic (MEG) metrics associated with responses to
      pure-tone sounds with frequencies sampled from a Gaussian distribution. We
      observed that sounds in the tail of the distribution evoked a larger
      response than those that fell at the centre. This response resembled the
      mismatch negativity (MMN) evoked by surprising or unlikely events in
      traditional oddball paradigms. Crucially, responses to physically
      identical outliers were greater when the distribution was narrower. These
      results show that humans implicitly keep track of the uncertainty induced
      by apparently random distributions of sensory events. Source
      reconstruction suggested that the statistical-context-sensitive responses
      arose in a temporo-parietal network, areas that have been associated with
      attention orientation to unexpected events. Our results demonstrate a very
      early neurophysiological marker of the brain's ability to implicitly
      encode complex statistical structure in the environment. We suggest that
      this sensitivity provides a computational basis for our ability to make
      perceptual inferences in noisy environments and to make decisions in an
      uncertain world.

AB  - Most decisions involve some element of uncertainty. When the outcomes of
      these decisions have different likelihoods of occurrence, the
      decision-maker must consider both the magnitude of each outcome and the
      probability of its occurrence, but how do individual decision makers
      combine the two dimensions of magnitude and probability? Here, we approach
      the problem by separating in time the presentation of magnitude and
      probability information, and focus the analysis of fMRI activations on the
      first piece of information only. Thus, we are able to identify distinct
      neural circuits for the two dimensions without the confounding effect of
      divided attention or the cognitive operation of combining them. We find
      that magnitude information correlates with the size of the response of the
      ventral striatum while probability information correlates with the
      response in the dorsal striatum. The relative responsiveness of these two
      striatal regions correlates with the behavioral tendency to weight one
      more than the other. The results are consistent with a second-order
      process of information aggregation in which individuals make separate
      judgments for magnitude and probability and then integrate those
      judgments.

AB  - This Perspective considers the influential notion of a canonical
      (cortical) microcircuit in light of recent theories about neuronal
      processing. Specifically, we conciliate quantitative studies of
      microcircuitry and the functional logic of neuronal computations. We
      revisit the established idea that message passing among hierarchical
      cortical areas implements a form of Bayesian inference-paying careful
      attention to the implications for intrinsic connections among neuronal
      populations. By deriving canonical forms for these computations, one can
      associate specific neuronal populations with specific computational roles.
      This analysis discloses a remarkable correspondence between the
      microcircuitry of the cortical column and the connectivity implied by
      predictive coding. Furthermore, it provides some intuitive insights into
      the functional asymmetries between feedforward and feedback connections
      and the characteristic frequencies over which they operate.

AB  - The thalamus is classically viewed as passively relaying information to
      the cortex. However, there is growing evidence that the thalamus actively
      regulates information transmission to the cortex and between cortical
      areas using a variety of mechanisms, including the modulation of response
      magnitude, firing mode, and synchrony of neurons according to behavioral
      demands. We discuss how the visual thalamus contributes to attention,
      awareness, and visually guided actions, to present a general role for the
      thalamus in perception and cognition.

AB  - Selective attention mechanisms route behaviorally relevant information
      through large-scale cortical networks. Although evidence suggests that
      populations of cortical neurons synchronize their activity to
      preferentially transmit information about attentional priorities, it is
      unclear how cortical synchrony across a network is accomplished. Based on
      its anatomical connectivity with the cortex, we hypothesized that the
      pulvinar, a thalamic nucleus, regulates cortical synchrony. We mapped
      pulvino-cortical networks within the visual system, using diffusion tensor
      imaging, and simultaneously recorded spikes and field potentials from
      these interconnected network sites in monkeys performing a visuospatial
      attention task. The pulvinar synchronized activity between interconnected
      cortical areas according to attentional allocation, suggesting a critical
      role for the thalamus not only in attentional selection but more generally
      in regulating information transmission across the visual cortex.

AB  - Recent studies (Driver et al., 1999; Friesen & Kingstone, 1998; Langton &
      Bruce, 1999) have argued that the perception of eye gaze may be unique, as
      compared with other symbolic cues (e.g., arrows), in being able to
      automatically trigger attentional orienting. In Experiment 1, 17
      participants took part in a visuospatial orienting task to investigate
      whether arrow cues might also trigger automatic orienting. Two arrow cues
      were presented for 75 msec to the left and right of a fixation asterisk.
      After an interval of either 25 or 225 msec, the letter O or X appeared.
      After both time intervals, mean response times were reliably faster when
      the arrows pointed toward, rather than away from, the location of the
      target letter. This occurred despite the fact that the participants were
      informed that the arrows did not predict where the target would appear. In
      Experiment 2, the same pattern of data was recorded when several
      adjustments had been made in an attempt to rule out alternative
      explanations for the cuing effects. Overall, the findings suggest that the
      eye gaze is not unique in automatically triggering orienting.

AB  - The basal ganglia are a chain of subcortical nuclei that facilitate action
      selection. Two striatal projection systems--so-called direct and indirect
      pathways--form the functional backbone of the basal ganglia circuit.
      Twenty years ago, investigators proposed that the striatum's ability to
      use dopamine (DA) rise and fall to control action selection was due to the
      segregation of D(1) and D(2) DA receptors in direct- and indirect-pathway
      spiny projection neurons. Although this hypothesis sparked a debate, the
      evidence that has accumulated since then clearly supports this model.
      Recent advances in the means of marking neural circuits with optical or
      molecular reporters have revealed a clear-cut dichotomy between these two
      cell types at the molecular, anatomical, and physiological levels. The
      contrast provided by these studies has provided new insights into how the
      striatum responds to fluctuations in DA signaling and how diseases that
      alter this signaling change striatal function.

AB  - Learning and memory and navigation literatures emphasize interactions
      between multiple memory systems: a flexible, planning-based system and a
      rigid, cached-value system. This has profound implications for
      decision-making. Recent conceptualizations of flexible decision-making
      employ prospection and projection arising from a network involving the
      hippocampus. Recent recordings from rodent hippocampus in decision-making
      situations have found transient forward-shifted representations.
      Evaluation of that prediction and subsequent action-selection probably
      occurs downstream (e.g. in orbitofrontal cortex, in ventral and
      dorsomedial striatum). Classically, striatum has been identified as a
      crucial component of the less-flexible, incremental system. Current
      evidence, however, suggests that striatum is involved in both flexible and
      stimulus-response decision-making, with dorsolateral striatum involved in
      stimulus-response strategies and ventral and dorsomedial striatum involved
      in goal-directed strategies.

AB  - This article focuses on the interaction between the basal ganglia (BG) and
      prefrontal cortex (PFC). The BG are a group of nuclei at the base of the
      forebrain that are highly connected with cortex. A century of research
      suggests that the role of the BG is not exclusively motor, and that the BG
      also play an important role in learning and memory. In this review
      article, we argue that one important role of the BG is to train
      connections between posterior cortical areas and frontal cortical regions
      that are responsible for automatic behavior after extensive training.
      According to this view, one effect of BG trial-and-error learning is to
      activate the correct frontal areas shortly after posterior associative
      cortex activation, thus allowing for Hebbian learning of robust, fast, and
      efficient cortico-cortical processing. This hypothesized process is
      general, and the content of the learned associations depends on the
      specific areas involved (e.g., associations involving premotor areas would
      be more closely related to behavior than associations involving the PFC).
      We review experiments aimed at pinpointing the function of the BG and the
      frontal cortex and show that these results are consistent with the view
      that the BG is a general purpose trainer for cortico-cortical connections.
      We conclude with a discussion of some implications of the integrative
      framework and how this can help better understand the role of the BG in
      many different tasks.

AB  - An enduring and richly elaborated dichotomy in cognitive neuroscience is
      that of reflective versus reflexive decision making and choice. Other
      literatures refer to the two ends of what is likely to be a spectrum with
      terms such as goal-directed versus habitual, model-based versus model-free
      or prospective versus retrospective. One of the most rigorous traditions
      of experimental work in the field started with studies in rodents and
      graduated via human versions and enrichments of those experiments to a
      current state in which new paradigms are probing and challenging the very
      heart of the distinction. We review four generations of work in this
      tradition and provide pointers to the forefront of the field's fifth
      generation.

AB  - Progressive loss of the ascending dopaminergic projection in the basal
      ganglia is a fundamental pathological feature of Parkinson's disease.
      Studies in animals and humans have identified spatially segregated
      functional territories in the basal ganglia for the control of
      goal-directed and habitual actions. In patients with Parkinson's disease
      the loss of dopamine is predominantly in the posterior putamen, a region
      of the basal ganglia associated with the control of habitual behaviour.
      These patients may therefore be forced into a progressive reliance on the
      goal-directed mode of action control that is mediated by comparatively
      preserved processing in the rostromedial striatum. Thus, many of their
      behavioural difficulties may reflect a loss of normal automatic control
      owing to distorting output signals from habitual control circuits, which
      impede the expression of goal-directed action.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's
      disease is known to cause a subtle but important adverse impact on
      behaviour, with impulsivity its most widely reported manifestation.
      However, precisely which computational components of the decision process
      are modulated is not fully understood. Here we probe a number of distinct
      subprocesses, including temporal discount, outcome utility, instrumental
      learning rate, instrumental outcome sensitivity, reward-loss trade-offs,
      and perseveration. We tested 22 Parkinson's Disease patients both on and
      off subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS), while they
      performed an instrumental learning task involving financial rewards and
      losses, and an inter-temporal choice task for financial rewards. We found
      that instrumental learning performance was significantly worse following
      stimulation, due to modulation of instrumental outcome sensitivity.
      Specifically, patients became less sensitive to decision values for both
      rewards and losses, but without any change to the learning rate or
      reward-loss trade-offs. However, we found no evidence that DBS modulated
      different components of temporal impulsivity. In conclusion, our results
      implicate the subthalamic nucleus in a modulation of outcome value in
      experience-based learning and decision-making in Parkinson's disease,
      suggesting a more pervasive role of the subthalamic nucleus in the control

AB  - The capacity to flexibly respond to contextual changes is crucial to
      adapting to a dynamic environment. Compulsivity, or behavioural
      inflexibility, consists of heterogeneous subtypes with overlapping yet
      discrete neural substrates. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) mediates the
      switch from automatic to controlled processing to slow, break or stop
      behaviour when necessary. Rodent STN lesions or inactivation are linked
      with perseveration or repetitive, compulsive responding. However, there
      are few studies examining the role of latent STN-centric neural networks
      and compulsive behaviour in healthy individuals. We therefore aimed to
      characterize the relationship between measures of compulsivity
      (goal-directed and habit learning, perseveration, and self-reported
      obsessive - compulsive symptoms) and the intrinsic resting state network
      of the STN. We scanned 77 healthy controls using a multi-echo resting
      state functional MRI sequence analyzed using independent components
      analysis (ME-ICA) with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio to examine small
      subcortical structures. Goal directed model-based behaviour was associated
      with higher connectivity of STN with medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC)
      and ventral striatum (VS) and more habitual model-free learning was
      associated with STN connectivity with hippocampus and dorsal anterior
      cingulate cortex (ACC). Perseveration was associated with reduced
      connectivity between STN and premotor cortex and finally, higher obsessive
      -compulsive inventory scores were associated with reduced STN connectivity
      with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PF). We highlight unique
      contributions of diffuse cortico-striatal functional connections with STN
      in dissociable measures of compulsivity. These findings are relevant to
      the development of potential biomarkers of treatment response in
      neurosurgical procedures targeting the STN for neurological and
      psychiatric disorders.

AB  - Classically, the basal ganglia have been considered to have a role in
      producing habitual and goal-directed behaviours. In this article, we
      review recent evidence that expands this role, indicating that the basal
      ganglia are also involved in neural and behavioural inhibition in the
      motor and non-motor domains. We then distinguish between goal-directed and
      habitual (also known as automatic) inhibition mediated by
      fronto-striato-subthalamic-pallido-thalamo-cortical networks. We also
      suggest that imbalance between goal-directed and habitual action and
      inhibition contributes to some manifestations of Parkinson's disease,
      Tourette syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Finally, we propose
      that basal ganglia surgery improves these disorders by restoring a
      functional balance between facilitation and inhibition.

AB  - It takes effort and time to tame one's impulses. Although medial
      prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is broadly implicated in effortful control over
      behavior, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is specifically thought to
      contribute by acting as a brake on cortico-striatal function during
      decision conflict, buying time until the right decision can be made. Using
      the drift diffusion model of decision making, we found that trial-to-trial
      increases in mPFC activity (EEG theta power, 4-8 Hz) were related to an
      increased threshold for evidence accumulation (decision threshold) as a
      function of conflict. Deep brain stimulation of the STN in individuals
      with Parkinson's disease reversed this relationship, resulting in
      impulsive choice. In addition, intracranial recordings of the STN area
      revealed increased activity (2.5-5 Hz) during these same high-conflict
      decisions. Activity in these slow frequency bands may reflect a neural
      substrate for cortico-basal ganglia communication regulating decision
      processes.

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease often alleviates the
      motor symptoms, but causes cognitive and emotional side effects in a
      substantial number of cases. Identification of the motor part of the
      subthalamic nucleus (STN) as part of the presurgical workup could minimize
      these adverse effects. In this study, we assessed the STN's connectivity
      to motor, associative, and limbic brain areas, based on structural and
      functional connectivity analysis of volunteer data. For the structural
      connectivity, we used streamline counts derived from HARDI fiber tracking.
      The resulting tracks supported the existence of the so-called
      "hyperdirect" pathway in humans. Furthermore, we determined the
      connectivity of each STN voxel with the motor cortical areas. Functional
      connectivity was calculated based on functional MRI, as the correlation of
      the signal within a given brain voxel with the signal in the STN. Also,
      the signal per STN voxel was explained in terms of the correlation with
      motor or limbic brain seed ROI areas. Both right and left STN ROIs
      appeared to be structurally and functionally connected to brain areas that
      are part of the motor, associative, and limbic circuit. Furthermore, this
      study enabled us to assess the level of segregation of the STN motor part,
      which is relevant for the planning of STN DBS procedures.

AB  - To test the hypothesis that deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic
      nucleus (STN) restores the inhibitory output to the striatothalamocortical
      loop in Parkinson's disease, we obtained functional brain images of blood
      flow in 10 STN-stimulated patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients were
      immobile and off antiparkinsonian medication for 12 h. They were scanned
      with and without bilateral STN-stimulation with a 4-h interval between the
      two conditions. The order of DBS stimulation (ON or OFF) was randomized.
      Stimulation significantly raised regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)
      bilaterally in the STN and in the left nucleus lentiformis. Conversely,
      flow declined in the left supplementary motor area (BA 6), ventrolateral
      nucleus of the left thalamus, and right cerebellum. Activation of the
      basal ganglia and deactivation of supplementary motor area and thalamus
      were both correlated with the improvement of motor function. The result is
      consistent with the explanation that stimulation in resting patients
      raises output from the STN with activation of the inhibitory basal ganglia
      output nuclei and subsequent deactivation of the thalamic anteroventral
      and ventrolateral nuclei and the supplementary motor area.

AB  - To achieve accuracy in studying the patterns of loss of midbrain
      dopamine-containing neurons in Parkinson's disease, we used compartmental
      patterns of calbindin D(28K) immunostaining to subdivide the substantia
      nigra with landmarks independent of the degenerative process. Within the
      substantia nigra pars compacta, we identified dopamine-containing neurons
      in the calbindin-rich regions ('matrix') and in five calbindin-poor
      pockets ('nigrosomes') defined by analysis of the three-dimensional
      networks formed by the calbindin-poor zones. These zones were recognizable
      in all of the brains, despite severe loss of dopamine-containing neurons.
      The degree of loss of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra
      pars compacta was related to the duration of the disease, and the cell
      loss followed a strict order. The degree of neuronal loss was
      significantly higher in the nigrosomes than in the matrix. Depletion was
      maximum (98%) in the main pocket (nigrosome 1), located in the caudal and
      mediolateral part of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Progressively
      less cell loss was detectable in more medial and more rostral nigrosomes,
      following the stereotyped order of nigrosome 1 > nigrosome 2 > nigrosome 4
      > nigrosome 3 > nigrosome 5. A parallel, but lesser, caudorostral gradient
      of cell loss was observed for dopamine-containing neurons included in the
      matrix. This pattern of neuronal loss was consistent from one parkinsonian
      substantia nigra pars compacta to another. The spatiotemporal progression
      of neuronal loss related to disease duration can thus be drawn in the
      substantia nigra pars compacta for each Parkinson's disease patient:
      depletion begins in the main pocket (nigrosome 1) and then spreads to
      other nigrosomes and the matrix along rostral, medial and dorsal axes of
      progression.

AB  - Cognitive flexibility is known to depend on the striatum. However, the
      striatum does not act in isolation to bias cognitive flexibility. In
      particular, cognitive flexibility also implicates the frontal cortex. Here
      we tested the hypothesis that the human frontal cortex controls cognitive
      flexibility by regulating striatal function via topographically specific
      frontostriatal connections. To this end, we exploited a repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol over frontal cortex that
      is known to increase dopamine release in the striatum. This intervention
      was combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging to determine the
      functional and topographic specificity of its consequences at the whole
      brain level. Participants were scanned both before and after off-line TMS
      while performing a cognitive switching task that is known to depend on a
      specific striatal substructure, the putamen. Frontal stimulation perturbed
      task-specific functional signals in the putamen, while reducing
      fronto-striatal functional connectivity. There were no such effects of TMS
      over the medial parietal cortex. These data strengthen the hypothesis that
      cognitive flexibility involves topographic frontal control of striatal
      function.

AB  - This paper considers prediction and perceptual categorization as an
      inference problem that is solved by the brain. We assume that the brain
      models the world as a hierarchy or cascade of dynamical systems that
      encode causal structure in the sensorium. Perception is equated with the
      optimization or inversion of these internal models, to explain sensory
      data. Given a model of how sensory data are generated, we can invoke a
      generic approach to model inversion, based on a free energy bound on the
      model's evidence. The ensuing free-energy formulation furnishes equations
      that prescribe the process of recognition, i.e. the dynamics of neuronal
      activity that represent the causes of sensory input. Here, we focus on a
      very general model, whose hierarchical and dynamical structure enables
      simulated brains to recognize and predict trajectories or sequences of
      sensory states. We first review hierarchical dynamical models and their
      inversion. We then show that the brain has the necessary infrastructure to
      implement this inversion and illustrate this point using synthetic birds
      that can recognize and categorize birdsongs.

AB  - Goal-directed and stimulus-driven factors determine attentional priority
      through a well defined dorsal frontal-parietal and ventral
      temporal-parietal network of brain regions, respectively. Recent evidence
      demonstrates that reward-related stimuli also have high attentional
      priority, independent of their physical salience and goal-relevance. The
      neural mechanisms underlying such value-driven attentional control are
      unknown. Using human functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate
      that the tail of the caudate nucleus and extrastriate visual cortex
      respond preferentially to task-irrelevant but previously reward-associated
      objects, providing an attentional priority signal that is sensitive to
      reward history. The caudate tail has not been implicated in the control of
      goal-directed or stimulus-driven attention, but is well suited to mediate
      the value-driven control of attention. Our findings reveal the neural
      basis of value-based attentional priority.

AB  - The visual system receives a wealth of sensory information of which only
      little is relevant for behaviour. We present a mechanism in which alpha
      oscillations serve to prioritize different components of visual
      information. By way of simulated neuronal networks, we show that
      inhibitory modulation in the alpha range (~ 10 Hz) can serve to temporally
      segment the visual information to prevent information overload. Coupled
      excitatory and inhibitory neurons generate a gamma rhythm in which
      information is segmented and sorted according to excitability in each

      patterns within each gamma cycle. The network model produces coupling
      between alpha phase and gamma (40-100 Hz) amplitude in the simulated local
      field potential similar to that observed experimentally in human and
      animal recordings.

AB  - Recent developments in the quantitative analysis of complex networks,
      based largely on graph theory, have been rapidly translated to studies of
      brain network organization. The brain's structural and functional systems
      have features of complex networks--such as small-world topology, highly
      connected hubs and modularity--both at the whole-brain scale of human
      neuroimaging and at a cellular scale in non-human animals. In this
      article, we review studies investigating complex brain networks in diverse
      experimental modalities (including structural and functional MRI,
      diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography and
      electroencephalography in humans) and provide an accessible introduction
      to the basic principles of graph theory. We also highlight some of the
      technical challenges and key questions to be addressed by future
      developments in this rapidly moving field.

AB  - Neuronal synchronization reflected by oscillatory brain activity has been
      strongly implicated in the mechanisms supporting selective gating. We here
      aimed at identifying the anatomical pathways in humans supporting the
      top-down control of neuronal synchronization. We first collected diffusion
      imaging data using magnetic resonance imaging to identify the medial
      branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), a white-matter tract
      connecting frontal control areas to parietal regions. We then quantified
      the modulations in oscillatory activity using magnetoencephalography in
      the same subjects performing a spatial attention task. We found that
      subjects with a stronger SLF volume in the right compared to the left
      hemisphere (or vice versa) also were the subjects who had a better ability
      to modulate right compared to left hemisphere alpha and gamma band
      synchronization, with the latter also predicting biases in reaction time.
      Our findings implicate the medial branch of the SLF in mediating top-down
      control of neuronal synchronization in sensory regions that support
      selective attention.

AB  - Attention can be focused volitionally by "top-down" signals derived from
      task demands and automatically by "bottom-up" signals from salient
      stimuli. The frontal and parietal cortices are involved, but their neural
      activity has not been directly compared. Therefore, we recorded from them
      simultaneously in monkeys. Prefrontal neurons reflected the target
      location first during top-down attention, whereas parietal neurons
      signaled it earlier during bottom-up attention. Synchrony between frontal
      and parietal areas was stronger in lower frequencies during top-down
      attention and in higher frequencies during bottom-up attention. This
      result indicates that top-down and bottom-up signals arise from the
      frontal and sensory cortex, respectively, and different modes of attention
      may emphasize synchrony at different frequencies.

AB  - Neuronal responses to stimuli, measured electrophysiologically, unfold
      over several hundred milliseconds. Typically, they show characteristic
      waveforms with early and late components. It is thought that early or
      exogenous components reflect a perturbation of neuronal dynamics by
      sensory input bottom-up processing. Conversely, later, endogenous
      components have been ascribed to recurrent dynamics among hierarchically
      disposed cortical processing levels, top-down effects. Here, we show that
      evoked brain responses are generated by recurrent dynamics in cortical
      networks, and late components of event-related responses are mediated by
      backward connections. This evidence is furnished by dynamic causal
      modeling of mismatch responses, elicited in an oddball paradigm. We used
      the evidence for models with and without backward connections to assess
      their likelihood as a function of peristimulus time and show that backward
      connections are necessary to explain late components. Furthermore, we were
      able to quantify the contribution of backward connections to evoked
      responses and to source activity, again as a function of peristimulus
      time. These results link a generic feature of brain responses to changes
      in the sensorium and a key architectural component of functional anatomy;
      namely, backward connections are necessary for recurrent interactions
      among levels of cortical hierarchies. This is the theoretical cornerstone
      of most modern theories of perceptual inference and learning.

AB  - Although the mammalian neocortex has a clear laminar organization,
      layer-specific neuronal computations remain to be uncovered. Several
      studies suggest that gamma band activity in primary visual cortex (V1) is
      produced in granular and superficial layers and is associated with the
      processing of visual input [1–3]. Oscillatory alpha band activity in
      deeper layers has been proposed to modulate neuronal excitability
      associated with changes in arousal and cognitive factors [4–7]. To
      investigate the layer-specific interplay between these two phenomena, we
      characterized the coupling between alpha and gamma band activity of the
      local field potential in V1 of the awake macaque. Using multicontact
      laminar electrodes to measure spontaneous signals simultaneously from all
      layers of V1, we found a robust coupling between alpha phase in the deeper
      layers and gamma amplitude in granular and superficial layers. Moreover,
      the power in the two frequency bands was anticorrelated. Taken together,
      these findings demonstrate robust interlaminar cross-frequency coupling in
      the visual cortex, supporting the view that neuronal activity in the alpha
      frequency range phasically modulates processing in the cortical
      microcircuit in a top-down manner [7].

AB  - Despite there being an increasing number of installations of ultra high
      field MR systems (>3T) in clinical environments, no functional patient
      investigations have yet examined possible benefits for functional
      diagnostics. Here we performed presurgical localization of the primary
      motor hand area on 3T and 7T Siemens scanners with identical
      investigational procedures and comparable system specific sequence
      optimizations. Results from 17 patients showed significantly higher
      functional sensitivity of the 7T system measured via percent signal
      change, mean t-values, number of suprathreshold voxels and contrast to
      noise ratio. On the other hand, 7T data suffered from a significant
      increase of artifacts (ghosting, head motion). We conclude that ultra high
      field systems provide a clinically relevant increase of functional
      sensitivity for patient investigations.

AB  - Researchers have shown that people often miss the occurrence of an
      unexpected yet salient event if they are engaged in a different task, a
      phenomenon known as inattentional blindness. However, demonstrations of
      inattentional blindness have typically involved naive observers engaged in
      an unfamiliar task. What about expert searchers who have spent years
      honing their ability to detect small abnormalities in specific types of
      images? We asked 24 radiologists to perform a familiar lung-nodule
      detection task. A gorilla, 48 times the size of the average nodule, was
      inserted in the last case that was presented. Eighty-three percent of the
      radiologists did not see the gorilla. Eye tracking revealed that the
      majority of those who missed the gorilla looked directly at its location.
      Thus, even expert searchers, operating in their domain of expertise, are
      vulnerable to inattentional blindness.

AB  - Movement disorders arise from the complex interplay of multiple changes to
      neural circuits. Successful treatments for these disorders could interact
      with these complex changes in myriad ways, and as a consequence their
      mechanisms of action and their amelioration of symptoms are incompletely
      understood. Using Parkinson9s disease as a case-study, we review here how
      computational models are a crucial tool for taming this complexity, across
      causative mechanisms, consequent neural dynamics, and treatments. For
      mechanisms, we review models that capture the effects of losing dopamine
      on basal ganglia function; for dynamics, we discuss models that have
      transformed our understanding of how beta- band (15-30 Hz) oscillations
      arise in the parkinsonian basal ganglia. For treatments, we touch on the
      breadth of computational modelling work trying to understand the
      therapeutic actions of deep brain stimulation. Collectively, models from
      across all levels of description are providing a compelling account of the
      causes, symptoms, and treatments for Parkinson9s disease

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate gender differences in basic disease
      characteristics, motor deterioration and nigrostriatal degeneration in
      Parkinson's disease (PD). METHODS: We studied 253 consecutive PD patients
      who were not receiving levodopa or dopamine agonists (disease duration <
      or = 10 years). We investigated the influence of gender and oestrogen
      status on: (1) age at onset, (2) presenting symptom, (3) severity and
      progression of motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
      III (UPDRS-III) scores) and (4) amount and progression of nigrostriatal
      degeneration ([123I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography
      measurements). RESULTS: Age at onset was 2.1 years later in women (53.4
      years) than in men (51.3 years). In women, age at onset correlated
      positively with parity, age at menopause and fertile life span. Women more
      often presented with tremor (67%) than men (48%). Overall, patients
      presenting with tremor had a 3.6 year higher age at onset and a 38% slower
      UPDRS-III deterioration. Mean UPDRS-III scores at disease onset were equal
      for both genders, as was the rate of deterioration. Women had a 16% higher
      striatal [123I]FP-CIT binding than men at symptom onset and throughout the
      course of PD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, in women, the
      development of symptomatic PD may be delayed by higher physiological
      striatal dopamine levels, possibly due to the activity of oestrogens. This
      could explain the epidemiological observations of a lower incidence and
      higher age at onset in women. Women also presented more often with tremor
      which, in turn, is associated with milder motor deterioration and striatal
      degeneration. Taken together, these findings suggest a more benign
      phenotype in women with PD.

AB  - Covertly directing visual attention toward a spatial location in the
      absence of visual stimulation enhances future visual processing at the
      attended position. The neuronal correlates of these attention shifts
      involve modulation of neuronal "baseline" activity in early visual areas,
      presumably through top-down control from higher-order attentional systems.
      We used electroencephalography to study the largely unknown relationship
      between these neuronal modulations and behavioral outcome in an attention
      orienting paradigm. Covert visuospatial attention shifts to either a left
      or right peripheral position in the absence of visual stimulation resulted
      in differential modulations of oscillatory alpha-band (8-14 Hz) activity
      over left versus right posterior sites. These changes were driven by
      varying degrees of alpha-decreases being maximal contralateral to the
      attended position. When expressed as a lateralization index, these
      alpha-changes differed significantly between attention conditions, with
      negative values (alpha_right < alpha_left) indexing leftward and more
      positive values (alpha_left < or = alpha_right) indexing rightward
      attention. Moreover, this index appeared deterministic for processing of
      forthcoming visual targets. Collapsed over trials, there was an advantage
      for left target processing in accordance with an overall negative bias in
      alpha-index values. Across trials, left targets were detected most rapidly
      when preceded by negative index values. Detection of right targets was
      fastest in trials with most positive values. Our data indicate that
      collateral modulations of posterior alpha-activity, the momentary bias of
      visuospatial attention, and imminent visual processing are linked. They
      suggest that the momentary direction of attention, predicting spatial
      biases in imminent visual processing, can be estimated from a
      lateralization index of posterior alpha-activity.

      oscillatory activity in the ventromedial striatum, a striatal region
      related to motivation-dependent learning. Early on as rats learned a
      T-maze task, bursts of 70- to 90-Hz high-γ activity were prominent during
      T-maze runs, but these gradually receded as bursts of 15- to 28-Hz β-band
      activity became pronounced. Populations of simultaneously recorded neurons
      synchronized their spike firing similarly during both the high-γ-band and
      β-band bursts. Thus, the structure of spike firing was reorganized during
      learning in relation to different rhythms. Spiking was concentrated around
      the troughs of the β-oscillations for fast-spiking interneurons and around
      the peaks for projection neurons, indicating alternating periods of firing
      at different frequencies as learning progressed. Spike-field synchrony was
      primarily local during high-γ-bursts but was widespread during β-bursts.
      The learning-related shift in the probability of high-γ and β-bursting
      thus could reflect a transition from a mainly focal rhythmic inhibition
      during early phases of learning to a more distributed mode of rhythmic
      inhibition as learning continues and behavior becomes habitual. These
      dynamics could underlie changing functions of the ventromedial striatum
      during habit formation. More generally, our findings suggest that
      coordinated changes in the spatiotemporal relationships of local field
      potential oscillations and spike activity could be hallmarks of the
      learning process.

AB  - Frequency-following and frequency-doubling neurons are ubiquitous in both
      striate and extrastriate visual areas. However, responses from these two
      types of neural populations have not been effectively compared in humans
      because previous EEG studies have not successfully dissociated responses
      from these populations. We devised a light-dark flicker stimulus that
      unambiguously distinguished these responses as reflected in the first and
      second harmonics in the steady-state visual evoked potentials. These
      harmonics revealed the spatial and functional segregation of
      frequency-following (the first harmonic) and frequency-doubling (the
      second harmonic) neural populations. Spatially, the first and second
      harmonics in steady-state visual evoked potentials exhibited divergent
      posterior scalp topographies for a broad range of EEG frequencies. The
      scalp maximum was medial for the first harmonic and contralateral for the
      second harmonic, a divergence not attributable to absolute response
      frequency. Functionally, voluntary visual-spatial attention strongly
      modulated the second harmonic but had negligible effects on the
      simultaneously elicited first harmonic. These dissociations suggest an
      intriguing possibility that frequency-following and frequency-doubling
      neural populations may contribute complementary functions to resolve the
      conflicting demands of attentional enhancement and signal fidelity--the
      frequency-doubling population may mediate substantial top-down signal
      modulation for attentional selection, whereas the frequency-following
      population may simultaneously preserve relatively undistorted sensory
      qualities regardless of the observer's cognitive state.

      Excitability

AB  - The brain exhibits organized fluctuations of neural activity, even in the
      absence of tasks or sensory input. A prominent type of such spontaneous
      activity is the alpha rhythm, which influences perception and interacts
      with other ongoing neural activity. It is currently hypothesized that
      states of decreased prestimulus α oscillations indicate enhanced neural
      excitability, resulting in improved perceptual acuity. Nevertheless, it
      remains debated how changes in excitability manifest at the behavioral
      level in perceptual tasks. We addressed this issue by comparing two
      alternative models describing the effect of spontaneous α power on signal
      detection. The first model assumes that decreased α power increases
      baseline excitability, amplifying the response to both signal and noise,
      predicting a liberal detection criterion with no effect on sensitivity.
      The second model predicts that decreased α power increases the
      trial-by-trial precision of the sensory response, resulting in improved
      sensitivity. We tested these models in two EEG experiments in humans where
      we analyzed the effects of prestimulus α power on visual detection and
      discrimination using a signal detection framework. Both experiments
      provide strong evidence that decreased α power reflects a more liberal
      detection criterion, rather than improved sensitivity, consistent with the
      baseline model. In other words, when the task requires detecting stimulus
      presence versus absence, reduced α oscillations make observers more likely
      to report the stimulus regardless of actual stimulus presence. Contrary to
      previous interpretations, these results suggest that states of decreased α
      oscillations increase the global baseline excitability of sensory systems
      without affecting perceptual acuity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Spontaneous
      fluctuations of brain activity explain why a faint sensory stimulus is
      sometimes perceived and sometimes not. The prevailing view is that
      heightened neural excitability, indexed by decreased α oscillations,
      promotes better perceptual performance. Here, we provide evidence that
      heightened neural excitability instead reflects a state of biased
      perception, during which a person is more likely to see a stimulus,
      whether or not it is actually present. Therefore, we propose that changes
      in neural excitability leave the precision of sensory processing
      unaffected. These results establish the link between spontaneous brain
      activity and the variability in human perception.

AB  - According to signal detection theoretical analyses, visual signals
      occurring at a cued location are detected more accurately, whereas
      frequently occurring ones are reported more often but are not better
      distinguished from noise. However, conventional analyses that estimate
      sensitivity and bias by comparing true- and false-positive rates offer
      limited insights into the mechanisms responsible for these effects. Here,
      we reassessed the prior influences of signal probability and relevance on
      visual contrast detection using a reverse-correlation technique that
      quantifies how signal-like fluctuations in noise predict trial-to-trial
      variability in choice discarded by conventional analyses. This approach
      allowed us to estimate separately the sensitivity of true and false
      positives to parametric changes in signal energy. We found that signal
      probability and relevance both increased energy sensitivity, but in
      dissociable ways. Cues predicting the relevant location increased
      primarily the sensitivity of true positives by suppressing internal noise
      during signal processing, whereas cues predicting greater signal
      probability increased both the frequency and the sensitivity of false
      positives by biasing the baseline activity of signal-selective units. We
      interpret these findings in light of "predictive-coding" models of
      perception, which propose separable top-down influences of expectation
      (probability driven) and attention (relevance driven) on bottom-up sensory
      processing.

AB  - Lateralization in the desynchronization of anticipatory occipitoparietal
      alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations has been implicated in the allocation of
      selective visuospatial attention. Previous studies have demonstrated that
      small changes in the lateralization of alpha-band activity are predictive
      of behavioral performance but have not directly investigated how flexibly
      alpha lateralization is linked to top-down attentional goals. To address
      this question, we presented participants with cues providing varying
      degrees of spatial certainty about the location at which a target would
      appear. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data demonstrated that manipulating
      spatial certainty led to graded changes in the extent to which alpha
      oscillations were lateralized over the occipitoparietal cortex during the
      cue-target interval. We found that individual differences in alpha
      desynchronization contralateral to attention predicted reaction times,
      event-related potential measures of perceptual processing of targets, and
      beta-band (15-25 Hz) activity typically associated with response
      preparation. These results support the hypothesis that anticipatory alpha
      modulation is a plausible neural mechanism underlying the allocation of
      visuospatial attention and is under flexible top-down control.

AB  - In naturalistic settings, observers often have to monitor multiple objects
      dispersed throughout the visual scene. However, the degree to which
      spatial attention can be divided across spatially noncontiguous objects
      has long been debated, particularly when those objects are in close
      proximity. Moreover, the temporal dynamics of divided attention are
      unclear: is the process of dividing spatial attention gradual and
      continuous, or does it onset in a discrete manner? To address these
      issues, we recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as
      subjects covertly monitored two flickering targets while ignoring an
      intervening distractor that flickered at a different frequency. All three
      stimuli were clustered within either the lower left or the lower right
      quadrant, and our dependent measure was SSVEP power at the target and
      distractor frequencies measured over time. In two experiments, we observed
      a temporally discrete increase in power for target- vs. distractor-evoked
      SSVEPs extending from ∼350 to 150 ms prior to correct (but not incorrect)
      responses. The divergence in SSVEP power immediately prior to a correct
      response suggests that spatial attention can be divided across
      noncontiguous locations, even when the targets are closely spaced within a
      single quadrant. In addition, the division of spatial attention appears to
      be relatively discrete, as opposed to slow and continuous. Finally, the
      predictive relationship between SSVEP power and behavior demonstrates that
      these neurophysiological measures of divided attention are meaningfully
      related to cognitive function.

AB  - Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) were recorded from the
      scalp of human subjects who were cued to attend to a rapid sequence of
      alphanumeric characters presented to one visual half-field while ignoring
      a concurrent sequence of characters in the opposite half-field. These
      two-character sequences were each superimposed upon a small square
      background that was flickered at a rate of 8.6 Hz in one half-field and 12
      Hz in the other half-field. The amplitude of the frequency-coded SSVEP
      elicited by either of the task-irrelevant flickering backgrounds was
      significantly enlarged when attention was focused upon the character
      sequence at the same location. This amplitude enhancement with attention
      was most prominent over occipital-temporal scalp areas of the right
      cerebral hemisphere regardless of the visual field of stimulation. These
      findings indicate that the SSVEP reflects an enhancement of neural
      responses to all stimuli that fall within the "spotlight" of spatial
      attention, whether or not the stimuli are task-relevant. Recordings of the
      SSVEP provide a new approach for studying the neural mechanisms and
      functional properties of selective attention to multi-element visual
      displays.

AB  - We propose a linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model of decision making
      and reaction time. The LBA is simpler than other models of choice response
      time, with independent accumulators that race towards a common response
      threshold. Activity in the accumulators increases in a linear and
      deterministic manner. The simplicity of the model allows complete analytic
      solutions for choices between any number of alternatives. These solutions
      (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both
      binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from five previously
      published experiments, we demonstrate that the LBA model successfully
      accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks
      that have proven difficult for other theoretical accounts. Our results are
      encouraging in a field beset by the tradeoff between complexity and
      completeness.

AB  - Dopamine eye drops produce marked dilatation of the pupil in man. This
      mydriatic effect is inhibited by pretreatment with guanethidine. It is
      therefore concluded that dopamine acts indirectly via adrenergic nerve
      endings, rather than exerting a direct effect on adrenergic receptors in
      the dilator pupillae muscle. In this respect dopamine resembles the
      phenyl-alkylamines, such as tyramine, rather than the catecholamines,
      adrenaline and noradrenaline.If dopamine acts by releasing noradrenaline
      from adrenergic nerve endings, high concentrations of dopamine could lead
      to depletion of noradrenaline stores, since synthesis might be unable to
      keep pace with release. This could be the explantion for the orthostatic
      hypotension found in patients taking L-dopa for Parkinsonism.

AB  - Reward-related mesolimbic dopamine steers animal behavior, creating
      automatic approach toward reward-associated objects and avoidance of
      objects unlikely to be beneficial. Theories of dopamine suggest that this
      reflects underlying biases in perception and attention, with reward
      enhancing the representation of reward-associated stimuli such that
      attention is more likely to be deployed to the location of these objects.
      Using measures of behavior and brain electricity in male and female
      humans, we demonstrate this to be the case. Sensory and perceptual
      processing of reward-associated visual features is facilitated such that
      attention is deployed to objects characterized by these features in
      subsequent experimental trials. This is the case even when participants
      know that a strategic decision to attend to reward-associated features
      will be counterproductive and result in suboptimal performance. Other
      results show that the magnitude of visual bias created by reward is
      predicted by the response to reward feedback in anterior cingulate cortex,
      an area with strong connections to dopaminergic structures in the
      midbrain. These results demonstrate that reward has an impact on vision
      that is independent of its role in the strategic establishment of

AB  - In a companion paper a new functional architecture was proposed for the
      basal ganglia based on the premise that these brain structures play a
      central role in behavioural action selection. The current paper
      quantitatively describes the properties of the model using analysis and
      simulation. The decomposition of the basal ganglia into selection and
      control pathways is supported in several ways. First, several elegant
      features are exposed--capacity scaling, enhanced selectivity and
      synergistic dopamine modulation--which might be expected to exist in a
      well designed action selection mechanism. The discovery of these features
      also lends support to the computational premise of selection that
      underpins our model. Second, good matches between model globus pallidus
      external segment output and globus pallidus internal segment and
      substantia nigra reticulata area output, and neurophysiological data, have
      been found which are indicative of common architectural features in the
      model and biological basal ganglia. Third, the behaviour of the model as a
      signal selection mechanism has parallels with some kinds of action
      selection observed in animals under various levels of dopaminergic
      modulation.

AB  - The basal ganglia, in particular the striatum, are central to theories of
      behavioral control, and often identified as a seat of action selection.
      Reinforcement learning (RL) models--which have driven much recent
      experimental work on this region--cast striatum as a dynamic controller,
      integrating sensory and motivational information to construct efficient
      and enriching behavioral policies. Befitting this informationally central
      role, the BG sit at the nexus of multiple anatomical 'loops' of synaptic
      projections, connecting a wide range of cortical and subcortical
      structures. Numerous pioneering anatomical studies conducted over the past
      several decades have meticulously catalogued these loops, and labeled them
      according to the inferred functions of the connected regions. The specific
      cotermina of the projections are highly localized to several different
      subregions of the striatum, leading to the suggestion that these
      subregions perform complementary but distinct functions. However, until
      recently, the dominant computational framework outlined only a bipartite,
      dorsal/ventral, division of striatum. We review recent computational and
      experimental advances that argue for a more finely fractionated
      delineation. In particular, experimental data provide extensive insight
      into unique functions subserved by the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). These
      functions appear to correspond well with theories of a 'model-based' RL
      subunit, and may also shed light on the suborganization of ventral
      striatum. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these ideas and how they
      point the way toward future refinements of neurocomputational theories of
      striatal function, bringing them into contact with other areas of
      computational theory and other regions of the brain.

AB  - We have examined the circuitry connecting the posterior parietal cortex
      with the frontal lobe of rhesus monkeys. HRP-WGA and tritiated amino acids
      were injected into subdivisions 7m, 7a, 7b, and 7ip of the posterior
      parietal cortex, and anterograde and retrograde label was recorded within
      the frontal motor and association cortices. Our main finding is that each
      subdivision of parietal cortex is connected with a unique set of frontal
      areas. Thus, area 7m, on the medial parietal surface, is interconnected
      with the dorsal premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area,
      including the supplementary eye field. Within the prefrontal cortex, area
      7m's connections are with the rostral sector of the frontal eye field
      (FEF), the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus, and the anterior bank of
      the inferior arcuate sulcus (Walker's area 45). In contrast, area 7a, on
      the posterior parietal convexity, is not linked with premotor regions but
      is heavily interconnected with the rostral FEF in the anterior bank of the
      superior arcuate sulcus, the dorsolateral prefrontal convexity, the
      rostral orbitofrontal cortex, area 45, and the fundus and adjacent cortex
      of the dorsal and ventral banks of the principal sulcus. Area 7b, in the
      anterior part of the posterior parietal lobule, is interconnected with
      still a different set of frontal areas, which include the ventral premotor
      cortex and supplementary motor area, area 45, and the external part of the
      ventral bank of the principal sulcus. The prominent connections of area
      7ip, in the posterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus, are with the
      supplementary eye field and restricted portions of the ventral premotor
      cortex, with a wide area of the FEF that includes both its rostral and
      caudal sectors, and with area 45. All frontoparietal connections are
      reciprocal, and although they are most prominent within a hemisphere,
      notable interhemispheric connections are also present. These findings
      provide a basis for a parcellation of the classically considered
      association cortex of the frontal lobe, particularly the cortex of the
      principal sulcus, into sectors defined by their specific connections with
      the posterior parietal subdivisions. Moreover, the present findings,
      together with those of a companion study (Cavada and Goldman-Rakic: J.
      Comp. Neurol. this issue) have allowed us to establish multiple linkages
      between frontal areas and specific limbic and sensory cortices through the
      posterior parietal cortex. The networks thus defined may form part of the
      neural substrate of parallel distributed processing in the cerebral
      cortex.

AB  - For many years there has been a debate about the role of the parietal lobe
      in the generation of behavior. Does it generate movement plans (intention)
      or choose objects in the environment for further processing? To answer
      this, we focus on the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), an area that has
      been shown to play independent roles in target selection for saccades and
      the generation of visual attention. Based on results from a variety of
      tasks, we propose that LIP acts as a priority map in which objects are
      represented by activity proportional to their behavioral priority. We
      present evidence to show that the priority map combines bottom-up inputs
      like a rapid visual response with an array of top-down signals like a
      saccade plan. The spatial location representing the peak of the map is
      used by the oculomotor system to target saccades and by the visual system
      to guide visual attention.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The ability to perform multiple, concurrent tasks efficiently
      is a much-desired cognitive skill, but one that remains elusive due to the
      brain's inherent information-processing limitations. Multitasking
      performance can, however, be greatly improved through cognitive training
      (Van Selst et al., 1999, Dux et al., 2009). Previous studies have examined
      how patterns of brain activity change following training (for review, see
      Kelly and Garavan, 2005). Here, in a large-scale human behavioral and
      imaging study of 100 healthy adults, we tested whether multitasking
      training benefits, assessed using a standard dual-task paradigm, are
      associated with variability in brain structure. We found that the volume
      of the rostral part of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
      predicted an individual's response to training. Critically, this
      association was observed exclusively in a task-specific training group,
      and not in an active-training control group. Our findings reveal a link
      between DLPFC structure and an individual's propensity to gain from
      training on a task that taps the limits of cognitive control. SIGNIFICANCE
      STATEMENT: Cognitive "brain" training is a rapidly growing, multibillion
      dollar industry (Hayden, 2012) that has been touted as the panacea for a
      variety of disorders that result in cognitive decline. A key process
      targeted by such training is "cognitive control." Here, we combined an
      established cognitive control measure, multitasking ability, with
      structural brain imaging in a sample of 100 participants. Our goal was to
      determine whether individual differences in brain structure predict the
      extent to which people derive measurable benefits from a cognitive
      training regime. Ours is the first study to identify a structural brain
      marker-volume of left hemisphere dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-associated
      with the magnitude of multitasking performance benefits induced by
      training at an individual level.

AB  - When humans attempt to perform two tasks at once, execution of the first
      task usually leads to postponement of the second one. This task delay is
      thought to result from a bottleneck occurring at a central, amodal stage
      of information processing that precludes two response selection or
      decision-making operations from being concurrently executed. Using
      time-resolved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), here we
      present a neural basis for such dual-task limitations, e.g. the inability
      of the posterior lateral prefrontal cortex, and possibly the superior
      medial frontal cortex, to process two decision-making operations at once.
      These results suggest that a neural network of frontal lobe areas acts as
      a central bottleneck of information processing that severely limits our
      ability to multitask.

AB  - Our ability to multitask is severely limited: task performance
      deteriorates when we attempt to undertake two or more tasks
      simultaneously. Remarkably, extensive training can greatly reduce such
      multitasking costs. While it is not known how training alters the brain to
      solve the multitasking problem, it likely involves the prefrontal cortex
      given this brain region's purported role in limiting multitasking
      performance. Here, we show that the reduction of multitasking interference
      with training is not achieved by diverting the flow of information
      processing away from the prefrontal cortex or by segregating prefrontal
      cells into independent task-specific neuronal ensembles, but rather by
      increasing the speed of information processing in this brain region,
      thereby allowing multiple tasks to be processed in rapid succession. These
      results not only reveal how training leads to efficient multitasking, they
      also provide a mechanistic account of multitasking limitations, namely the
      poor speed of information processing in human prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Learning and maintenance of skilled movements require exploration of motor
      space and selection of appropriate actions. Vocal learning and social
      context-dependent plasticity in songbirds depend on a basal ganglia
      circuit, which actively generates vocal variability. Dopamine in the basal
      ganglia reduces trial-to-trial neural variability when the bird engages in
      courtship song. Here, we present evidence for a unique, tonically active,
      excitatory interneuron in the songbird basal ganglia that makes strong
      synaptic connections onto output pallidal neurons, often linked in time
      with inhibitory events. Dopamine receptor activity modulates the coupling
      of these excitatory and inhibitory events in vitro, which results in a
      dynamic change in the synchrony of a modeled population of basal ganglia
      output neurons receiving excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The excitatory
      interneuron thus serves as one biophysical mechanism for the introduction
      or modulation of neural variability in this circuit.

AB  - The dorsal striatum has two functionally-defined subdivisions: a
      dorsomedial striatum (DMS) region involved in mediating goal-directed
      behaviors that require conscious effort, and a dorsolateral striatum (DLS)
      region involved in the execution of habitual behaviors in a familiar
      sensory context. Consistent with its presumed role in forming
      stimulus-response (S-R) associations, neurons in DLS receive massive
      inputs from sensorimotor cortex and are responsive to both active and
      passive sensory stimulation. While several studies have established that
      corticostriatal inputs contribute to the stimulus-induced responses
      observed in the DLS, there is growing awareness that the thalamus has a
      significant role in conveying sensory-related information to DLS and other
      parts of the striatum. The thalamostriatal projections to DLS originate
      mainly from the caudal intralaminar region, which contains the
      parafascicular (Pf) nucleus, and from higher-order thalamic nuclei such as
      the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Based on recent findings,
      we hypothesize that the thalamostriatal projections from these two regions
      exert opposing influences on the expression of behavioral habits. This
      article reviews the subcortical circuits that regulate the transmission of
      sensory information through these thalamostriatal projection systems, and
      describes the evidence that indicates these circuits could be manipulated
      to ameliorate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related
      neurological disorders.

AB  - The diffusion decision model allows detailed explanations of behavior in
      two-choice discrimination tasks. In this article, the model is reviewed to
      show how it translates behavioral data-accuracy, mean response times, and
      response time distributions-into components of cognitive processing. Three
      experiments are used to illustrate experimental manipulations of three
      components: stimulus difficulty affects the quality of information on
      which a decision is based; instructions emphasizing either speed or
      accuracy affect the criterial amounts of information that a subject
      requires before initiating a response; and the relative proportions of the
      two stimuli affect biases in drift rate and starting point. The
      experiments also illustrate the strong constraints that ensure the model
      is empirically testable and potentially falsifiable. The broad range of
      applications of the model is also reviewed, including research in the
      domains of aging and neurophysiology.

AB  - The monkey mesial area 6 comprises two distinct cytoarchitectonic areas:
      F3 [supplementary motor area properly defined (SMA-proper)], located
      caudally, and F6 (pre-SMA), located rostrally. The aim of the present
      study was to describe the corticocortical connections of these two areas.
      To this purpose restricted injections of neuronal tracers (wheat
      germ-agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, fluorescent tracers)
      were made in different somatotopic fields of F3, F6, and F1 (area 4) and
      their transport plotted. The results showed that F3 and F6 differ markedly
      in their cortical connections. F3 is richly linked with F1 and the
      posterior premotor and cingulate areas (F2, F4, 24d). Connections with the
      anterior premotor and cingulate areas (F6, F7, F5, 24c) although present,
      are relatively modest. There is no input from the prefrontal lobe. F3 is
      also connected with several postrolandic cortical areas. These connections
      are with areas PC, PE, and PEa in the superior parietal lobule, cingulate
      areas 23 and PEci, the opercular parietal areas (PFop, PGop, SII) and the
      granular insula. F6 receives a rich input from the anterior premotor areas
      (especially F5) and cingulate area 24c, whereas its input from the
      posterior premotor and cingulate areas is very weak. A strong input
      originates from area 46. There are no connections with F1. The connections
      with the postrolandic areas are extremely meagre. They are with areas PG
      and PFG in the inferior parietal lobule, the disgranular insula, and the
      superior temporal sulcus. A further result was the demonstration of a
      differential connectivity pattern of the cingulate areas 24d and 24c. Area
      24d is strongly linked with F1 and F3, whereas area 24c is connected
      mostly with F6. The present data support the notion that the classical SMA
      comprises two functionally distinct areas. They suggest that F6 (the
      rostral area) is responsible for the "SMA" so-called high level motor
      functions, whereas F3 (the caudal area) is more closely related to
      movement execution.

AB  - Anatomical, stimulation, and lesion data have suggested a homology between
      the rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) (centered at +2 AP, ±1.3 ML mm from
      Bregma) and primate frontal cortices such as the frontal or supplementary
      eye fields. We investigated the functional role of the FOF using rats
      trained to perform a memory-guided orienting task, in which there was a
      delay period between the end of a sensory stimulus instructing orienting
      direction and the time of the allowed motor response. Unilateral
      inactivation of the FOF resulted in impaired contralateral responses.
      Extracellular recordings of single units revealed that 37% of FOF neurons
      had delay period firing rates that predicted the direction of the rats'
      later orienting motion. Our data provide the first electrophysiological
      and pharmacological evidence supporting the existence in the rat, as in
      the primate, of a frontal cortical area involved in the preparation and/or
      planning of orienting responses.

AB  - Insight into the neural architecture of multitasking is crucial when
      investigating the pathophysiology of multitasking deficits in clinical
      populations. Presently, little is known about how the brain combines
      dual-tasking with a concurrent short-term memory task, despite the
      relevance of this mental operation in daily life and the frequency of
      complaints related to this process, in disease. In this study we aimed to
      examine how the brain responds when a memory task is added to
      dual-tasking. Thirty-three right-handed healthy volunteers (20 females,
      mean age 39.9 ± 5.8) were examined with functional brain imaging (fMRI).
      The paradigm consisted of two cross-modal single tasks (a visual and
      auditory temporal same-different task with short delay), a dual-task
      combining both single tasks simultaneously and a multi-task condition,
      combining the dual-task with an additional short-term memory task
      (temporal same-different visual task with long delay). Dual-tasking
      compared to both individual visual and auditory single tasks activated a
      predominantly right-sided fronto-parietal network and the cerebellum. When
      adding the additional short-term memory task, a larger and more bilateral
      frontoparietal network was recruited. We found enhanced activity during
      multitasking in components of the network that were already involved in
      dual-tasking, suggesting increased working memory demands, as well as
      recruitment of multitask-specific components including areas that are
      likely to be involved in online holding of visual stimuli in short-term
      memory such as occipito-temporal cortex. These results confirm concurrent
      neural processing of a visual short-term memory task during dual-tasking
      and provide evidence for an effective fMRI multitasking paradigm.

AB  - Extensive evidence suggests that the human ability to adaptively implement
      a wide variety of tasks is preferentially a result of the operation of a
      fronto-parietal brain network (FPN). We hypothesized that this network's
      adaptability is made possible by flexible hubs: brain regions that rapidly
      update their pattern of global functional connectivity according to task
      demands. Using recent advances in characterizing brain network
      organization and dynamics, we identified mechanisms consistent with the
      flexible hub theory. We found that the FPN's brain-wide functional
      connectivity pattern shifted more than those of other networks across a
      variety of task states and that these connectivity patterns could be used
      to identify the current task. Furthermore, these patterns were consistent
      across practiced and novel tasks, suggesting that reuse of flexible hub
      connectivity patterns facilitates adaptive (novel) task performance.
      Together, these findings support a central role for fronto-parietal
      flexible hubs in cognitive control and adaptive implementation of task
      demands.

AB  - Multitasking is a fundamental aspect of everyday life activities. To
      achieve a complex, multi-component goal, the tasks must be subdivided into
      sub-tasks and component steps, a critical function of prefrontal networks.
      The prefrontal cortex is considered to be organized in a cascade of
      executive processes from the sensorimotor to anterior prefrontal cortex,
      which includes execution of specific goal-directed action, to encoding and
      maintaining task rules, and finally monitoring distal goals. In the
      current study, we used a virtual multitasking paradigm to tap into
      real-world performance and relate it to each individual's resting-state
      functional connectivity in fMRI. While did not find any correlation
      between global connectivity of any of the major networks with multitasking
      ability, global connectivity of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was
      predictive of multitasking ability. Further analysis showed that
      multivariate connectivity patterns within the sensorimotor network (SMN),
      and between-network connectivity of the frontoparietal network (FPN) and
      dorsal attention network (DAN), predicted individual multitasking ability
      and could be generalized to novel individuals. Together, these results
      support previous research that prefrontal networks underlie multitasking
      abilities and show that connectivity patterns in the cascade of prefrontal
      networks may explain individual differences in performance.

AB  - A common or multiple-demand (MD) pattern of frontal and parietal activity
      is associated with diverse cognitive demands, and with standard tests of
      fluid intelligence. In intelligent behaviour, goals are achieved by
      assembling a series of sub-tasks, creating structured mental programs.
      Single cell and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data indicate
      a key role for MD cortex in defining and controlling the parts of such
      programs, with focus on the specific content of a current cognitive
      operation, rapid reorganization as mental focus is changed, and robust
      separation of successive task steps. Resembling the structured
      problem-solving of symbolic artificial intelligence, the mental programs
      of MD cortex appear central to intelligent thought and action.

AB  - The involvement of the prefrontal cortex in executive control has been
      well established. It is, however, as yet unclear whether the basal ganglia
      and the cerebellum as components of frontostriatal/frontocerebellar
      networks also contribute to the executive domains multitasking and
      response inhibition. To investigate this issue, groups of patients with
      selective vascular lesions of the basal ganglia (n=13) or the cerebellum
      (n=14) were compared with matched healthy control groups. Several
      paradigms assessing the ability to process concurrent visual and auditory
      input and to simultaneously perform verbal and manual responses as well as
      the inhibition of habitual or newly acquired response tendencies were
      administered. Basal ganglia patients showed marked response slowing during
      coordination of sensory input from different modalities and high error
      rates during the inhibition of overlearned responses. There was no clear
      evidence of a cerebellar involvement in multitasking or response
      suppression. Taken together, the findings provided evidence for a striatal
      involvement in both multitasking and response inhibition, emphasizing the
      functional implication of subcortical components in frontostriatal
      circuits.

AB  - Neuroimaging evidence suggests that executive functions (EF) depend on
      brain regions that are not closely tied to specific cognitive demands but
      rather to a wide range of behaviors. A multiple-demand (MD) system has
      been proposed, consisting of regions showing conjoint activation across
      multiple demands. Additionally, a number of studies defining networks
      specific to certain cognitive tasks suggest that the MD system may be
      composed of a number of sub-networks each subserving specific roles within
      the system. We here provide a robust definition of an extended MDN (eMDN)
      based on task-dependent and task-independent functional connectivity
      analyses seeded from regions previously shown to be convergently recruited
      across neuroimaging studies probing working memory, attention and
      inhibition, i.e., the proposed key components of EF. Additionally, we
      investigated potential sub-networks within the eMDN based on their
      connectional and functional similarities. We propose an eMDN network
      consisting of a core whose integrity should be crucial to performance of
      most operations that are considered higher cognitive or EF. This then
      recruits additional areas depending on specific demands.

AB  - The study of dual-task performance in human subjects has received
      considerable interest in cognitive neuroscience because it can provide
      detailed insights into the neural mechanisms underlying higher-order
      cognitive control. Despite many decades of research, our understanding of
      the neurobiological basis of dual-task performance is still limited, and
      some critical questions are still under debate. Recently, behavioral and
      neurophysiological studies of dual-task performance in animals have begun
      to provide intriguing evidence regarding how dual-task information is
      processed in the brain. In this review, we first summarize key evidence in
      neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies in humans and discuss possible
      reasons for discrepancies across studies. We then provide a comprehensive
      review of the literature on dual-task studies in animals and provide a
      novel working hypothesis that may reconcile the divergent results in human
      studies toward a unified view of the mechanisms underlying dual-task
      processing. Finally, we propose possible directions for future dual-task
      experiments in the framework of comparative cognitive neuroscience.

AB  - Neuronal activity in the putamen of monkeys was recorded while they
      performed operantly conditioned body movements. Two categories of neurons
      were observed. Type I cells had tonic spontaneous discharges and responded
      to the sensory trigger stimuli for movements with excitation followed by
      inhibition or with only inhibition. These responses to the trigger stimuli
      disappeared when the conditioned movement was extinguished. Type II cells
      were characterized by phasic activity time-locked to the movement. Two
      subclasses of type II cells were observed. Type IIa cells exhibited phasic
      discharges before the first movement of a learned, repetitive sequence of
      arm or orofacial movements that were triggered by the sensory stimuli.
      Type IIb cells showed phasic activity modulation during each movement in
      one direction, either flexion or extension, in an unconditioned manner.
      Activity of the type IIa cells preceded the onset of EMG in prime mover
      muscles, while most type IIb cells were activated after the EMG had
      appeared. Thus, in both type I and type IIa cells the activity can be said
      to be behaviourally contingent. Type I cells show a movement contingent
      sensory response, and type IIa cells show movement-related activity that
      is contingent upon the triggering of the movement by a sensory stimulus.

AB  - Decision formation recruits many brain regions, but the procedure they
      jointly execute is unknown. Here we characterize its essential
      composition, using as a framework a novel recursive Bayesian algorithm
      that makes decisions based on spike-trains with the statistics of those in
      sensory cortex (MT). Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we
      demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys,
      whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from MT. Its
      architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical
      loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show
      that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural
      activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and
      forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts
      which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our
      single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and
      parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and
      electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has
      these same characteristics.

AB  - Discrete yet overlapping frontal-striatal circuits mediate broadly
      dissociable cognitive and behavioural processes. Using a recently
      developed multi-echo resting-state functional MRI (magnetic resonance
      imaging) sequence with greatly enhanced signal compared to noise ratios,
      we map frontal cortical functional projections to the striatum and
      striatal projections through the direct and indirect basal ganglia
      circuit. We demonstrate distinct limbic (ventromedial prefrontal regions,
      ventral striatum - VS, ventral tegmental area - VTA), motor (supplementary
      motor areas - SMAs, putamen, substantia nigra) and cognitive (lateral
      prefrontal and caudate) functional connectivity. We confirm the functional
      nature of the cortico-striatal connections, demonstrating correlates of
      well-established goal-directed behaviour (involving medial orbitofrontal
      cortex - mOFC and VS), probabilistic reversal learning (lateral
      orbitofrontal cortex - lOFC and VS) and attentional shifting (dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex - dlPFC and VS) while assessing habitual model-free (SMA
      and putamen) behaviours on an exploratory basis. We further use neurite
      orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to show that more
      goal-directed model-based learning (MBc) is also associated with higher
      mOFC neurite density and habitual model-free learning (MFc) implicates
      neurite complexity in the putamen. This data highlights similarities
      between a computational account of MFc and conventional measures of habit
      learning. We highlight the intrinsic functional and structural
      architecture of parallel systems of behavioural control.

AB  - Both perceptual inference and motor responses are shaped by learned
      probabilities. For example, stimulus-induced responses in sensory cortices
      and preparatory activity in premotor cortex reflect how (un)expected a
      stimulus is. This is in accordance with predictive coding accounts of
      brain function, which posit a fundamental role of prediction errors for
      learning and adaptive behavior. We used functional magnetic resonance
      imaging and recent advances in computational modeling to investigate how
      (failures of) learned predictions about visual stimuli influence
      subsequent motor responses. Healthy volunteers discriminated visual
      stimuli that were differentially predicted by auditory cues. Critically,
      the predictive strengths of cues varied over time, requiring subjects to
      continuously update estimates of stimulus probabilities. This online
      inference, modeled using a hierarchical Bayesian learner, was reflected
      behaviorally: speed and accuracy of motor responses increased
      significantly with predictability of the stimuli. We used nonlinear
      dynamic causal modeling to demonstrate that striatal prediction errors are
      used to tune functional coupling in cortical networks during learning.
      Specifically, the degree of striatal trial-by-trial prediction error
      activity controls the efficacy of visuomotor connections and thus the
      influence of surprising stimuli on premotor activity. This finding
      substantially advances our understanding of striatal function and provides
      direct empirical evidence for formal learning theories that posit a
      central role for prediction error-dependent plasticity.

AB  - In dual-task situations, interference between two simultaneous tasks
      impairs performance. With practice, however, this impairment can be
      reduced. To identify mechanisms leading to a practice-related improvement
      in sensorimotor dual tasks, the present review applied the following
      general hypothesis: Sources that impair dual-task performance at the
      beginning of practice are associated with mechanisms for the reduction of
      dual-task impairment at the end of practice. The following types of
      processes provide sources for the occurrence of this impairment: (a)
      capacity-limited processes within the component tasks, such as
      response-selection or motor response stages, and (b) cognitive control
      processes independent of these tasks and thus operating outside of
      component-task performance. Dual-task practice studies show that, under
      very specific conditions, capacity-limited processes within the component
      tasks are automatized with practice, reducing the interference between two
      simultaneous tasks. Further, there is evidence that response-selection
      stages are shortened with practice. Thus, capacity limitations at these
      stages are sources for dual-task costs at the beginning of practice and
      are overcome with practice. However, there is no evidence demonstrating
      the existence of practice-related mechanisms associated with
      capacity-limited motor-response stages. Further, during practice, there is
      an acquisition of executive control skills for an improved allocation of
      limited attention resources to two tasks as well as some evidence
      supporting the assumption of improved task coordination. These latter
      mechanisms are associated with sources of dual-task interference operating
      outside of component task performance at the beginning of practice and
      also contribute to the reduction of dual-task interference at its end.

VL  - 7
PY  - 2018
DA  - 2018/5/31
AB  - It is generally believed that during economic decisions, striatal neurons
      represent the values associated with different actions. This hypothesis is
      based on studies, in which the activity of striatal neurons was measured
      while the subject was learning to prefer the more rewarding action. Here
      we show that these publications are subject to at least one of two
      critical confounds. First, we show that even weak temporal correlations in
      the neuronal data may result in an erroneous identification of
      action-value representations. Second, we show that experiments and
      analyses designed to dissociate action-value representation from the
      representation of other decision variables cannot do so. We suggest
      solutions to identifying action-value representation that are not subject
      to these confounds. Applying one solution to previously identified
      action-value neurons in the basal ganglia we fail to detect action-value
      representations. We conclude that the claim that striatal neurons encode
      action-values must await new experiments and analyses.

AB  - A broad range of decision-making processes involve gradual accumulation of
      evidence over time, but the neural circuits responsible for this
      computation are not yet established. Recent data indicate that cortical
      regions that are prominently associated with accumulating evidence, such
      as the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal orienting fields, may not
      be directly involved in this computation. Which, then, are the regions
      involved? Regions that are directly involved in evidence accumulation
      should directly influence the accumulation-based decision-making behavior,
      have a graded neural encoding of accumulated evidence and contribute
      throughout the accumulation process. Here, we investigated the role of the
      anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) in a rodent auditory evidence accumulation
      task using a combination of behavioral, pharmacological, optogenetic,
      electrophysiological and computational approaches. We find that the ADS is
      the first brain region known to satisfy the three criteria. Thus, the ADS
      may be the first identified node in the network responsible for evidence
      accumulation.

      abnormalities of movement, behaviour, learning, and emotions. The main
      motor features (ie, tremor, rigidity, and akinesia) are associated with a
      deficiency of dopamine in the posterior putamen and the motor circuit.
      Hypokinesia and bradykinesia might have a dual anatomo-functional basis:
      hypokinesia mediated by brainstem mechanisms and bradykinesia by cortical
      mechanisms. The classic pathophysiological model for PD (ie, hyperactivity
      in the globus pallidus pars interna and substantia nigra pars reticulata)
      does not explain rigidity and tremor, which might be caused by changes in
      primary motor cortex activity. Executive functions (ie, planning and
      problem solving) are also impaired in early PD, but are usually not
      clinically noticed. These impairments are associated with dopamine
      deficiency in the caudate nucleus and with dysfunction of the associative
      and other non-motor circuits. Apathy, anxiety, and depression are the main
      psychiatric manifestations in untreated PD, which might be caused by
      ventral striatum dopaminergic deficit and depletion of serotonin and
      norepinephrine. In this Review we discuss the motor, cognitive, and
      psychiatric manifestations associated with the dopaminergic deficiency in
      the early phase of the parkinsonian state and the different circuits
      implicated, and we propose distinct mechanisms to explain the wide
      clinical range of PD symptoms at the time of diagnosis.

AB  - The idea of two separate attention networks in the human brain for the
      voluntary deployment of attention and the reorientation to unexpected
      events, respectively, has inspired an enormous amount of research over the
      past years. In this review, we will reconcile these theoretical ideas on
      the dorsal and ventral attentional system with recent empirical findings
      from human neuroimaging experiments and studies in stroke patients. We
      will highlight how novel methods-such as the analysis of effective
      connectivity or the combination of neurostimulation with functional
      magnetic resonance imaging-have contributed to our understanding of the
      functionality and interaction of the two systems. We conclude that neither
      of the two networks controls attentional processes in isolation and that
      the flexible interaction between both systems enables the dynamic control
      of attention in relation to top-down goals and bottom-up sensory
      stimulation. We discuss which brain regions potentially govern this
      interaction according to current task demands.

AB  - The ability to select between possible responses to a given situation is
      central to human cognition. The goal of this study was to distinguish
      between brain areas representing candidate responses and areas selecting
      between competing response alternatives. Event-related fMRI data were
      acquired while 10 healthy adults performed a task used to examine response
      competition: the Eriksen flanker task. Left parietal cortex was activated
      by either of two manipulations that increased the need to maintain a
      representation of possible responses. In contrast, lateral prefrontal and
      rostral anterior cingulate cortices were specifically engaged by the need
      to select among competing response alternatives. These findings support
      the idea that parietal cortex is involved in activating possible responses
      on the basis of learned stimulus-response associations, and that
      prefrontal cortex is recruited when there is a need to select between
      competing responses.

AB  - Noninvasive parcellation of the human cerebral cortex is an important goal
      for understanding and examining brain functions. Recently, the patterns of
      anatomical connections using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been used
      to parcellate brain regions. Here, we present a noninvasive parcellation
      approach that uses "functional fingerprints" obtained by correlation
      measures on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
      data to parcellate brain regions. In other terms, brain regions are
      parcellated based on the similarity of their connection--as reflected by
      correlation during resting state--to the whole brain. The proposed method
      was used to parcellate the medial frontal cortex (MFC) into supplementary
      motor areas (SMA) and pre-SMA subregions. In agreement with anatomical
      landmark-based parcellation, we find that functional fingerprint
      clustering of the MFC results in anterior and posterior clusters. The
      probabilistic maps from 12 subjects showed that the anterior cluster is
      mainly located rostral to the vertical commissure anterior (VCA) line,
      whereas the posterior cluster is mainly located caudal to VCA line,
      suggesting the homologues of pre-SMA and SMA. The functional connections
      from the putative pre-SMA cluster were connected to brain regions which
      are responsible for complex/cognitive motor control, whereas those from
      the putative SMA cluster were connected to brain regions which are related
      to the simple motor control. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of
      the functional connectivity-based parcellation of the human cerebral
      cortex using resting state fMRI.

AB  - Concepts of basal ganglia organization have changed markedly over the past
      decade, due to significant advances in our understanding of the anatomy,
      physiology and pharmacology of these structures. Independent evidence from
      each of these fields has reinforced a growing perception that the
      functional architecture of the basal ganglia is essentially parallel in
      nature, regardless of the perspective from which these structures are
      viewed. This represents a significant departure from earlier concepts of
      basal ganglia organization, which generally emphasized the serial aspects
      of their connectivity. Current evidence suggests that the basal ganglia
      are organized into several structurally and functionally distinct
      'circuits' that link cortex, basal ganglia and thalamus, with each circuit
      focused on a different portion of the frontal lobe. In this review,
      Garrett Alexander and Michael Crutcher, using the basal ganglia 'motor'
      circuit as the principal example, discuss recent evidence indicating that
      a parallel functional architecture may also be characteristic of the
      organization within each individual circuit.

AB  - We present a biologically plausible model of processing intrinsic to the
      basal ganglia based on the computational premise that action selection is
      a primary role of these central brain structures. By encoding the
      propensity for selecting a given action in a scalar value (the salience),
      it is shown that action selection may be recast in terms of signal
      selection. The generic properties of signal selection are defined and
      neural networks for this type of computation examined. A comparison
      between these networks and basal ganglia anatomy leads to a novel
      functional decomposition of the basal ganglia architecture into
      'selection' and 'control' pathways. The former pathway performs the
      selection per se via a feedforward off-centre on-surround network. The
      control pathway regulates the action of the selection pathway to ensure
      its effective operation, and synergistically complements its dopaminergic
      modulation. The model contrasts with the prevailing functional segregation
      of basal ganglia into 'direct' and 'indirect' pathways.

AB  - Besides the nigro-collicular pathway, the nigro-thalamic projection to the
      ventromedial thalamic nucleus represents another efferent system of the
      basal ganglia through which striatum can influence motor centers. Since
      the striato-nigrothalamic circuit is composed of two successive GABAergic
      inhibitory links and the SNR is tonically active, we tested that by
      inhibiting nigrothalamic cells, the striatum may exert a facilitatory
      influence on VM-thalamocortical cells. We show that a transitory block of
      SNR (substantia nigra pars reticulata) firing (induced by either
      intranigral application of GABA or by stimulating the inhibitory
      striato-nigral pathway), causes a perfectly time-locked increase of
      activity in a large number of VM cells projecting to motor cortex.
      Moreover, the striatally evoked excitation of VM-thalamocortical cells
      requires the functional integrity of the GABAergic striato-nigral link. We
      conclude that the double inhibitory striato-nigrothalamic pathway acts on
      VM-thalamocortical cells through a disinhibitory mechanism. The functional
      implication of such a mechanism is discussed.

AB  - Simultaneous performance of two tasks often leads to performance deficits
      in the component tasks. This effect, known as dual-task interference, is
      thought to be a proof of capacity limitation in cognition, and the lateral
      prefrontal cortex (LPFC) has been highlighted as its putative neural
      substrate. Here we recorded single-neuron activities in LPFC while monkeys
      performed dual tasks that required the simultaneous performance of a
      varying-load spatial attention task and a spatial memory task. We found
      that the performance of the monkeys exhibited dual-task interference, and
      prefrontal neuron activities showed a decreased ability to represent
      task-relevant information to a degree proportional to the increased demand
      of the concurrent counterpart task. The locus of the interference was
      shown to originate in the simultaneous, overloaded recruitment of the same
      LPFC neural population by the two tasks. These results provide direct
      neurophysiological evidence for, and constraints to, psychological models
      of dual-task interference and capacity limitation.

AB  - The basal ganglia and the cerebellum are considered to be distinct
      subcortical systems that perform unique functional operations. The outputs
      of the basal ganglia and the cerebellum influence many of the same
      cortical areas but do so by projecting to distinct thalamic nuclei. As a
      consequence, the two subcortical systems were thought to be independent
      and to communicate only at the level of the cerebral cortex. Here, we
      review recent data showing that the basal ganglia and the cerebellum are
      interconnected at the subcortical level. The subthalamic nucleus in the
      basal ganglia is the source of a dense disynaptic projection to the
      cerebellar cortex. Similarly, the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum is the
      source of a dense disynaptic projection to the striatum. These
      observations lead to a new functional perspective that the basal ganglia,
      the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex form an integrated network. This
      network is topographically organized so that the motor, cognitive and
      affective territories of each node in the network are interconnected. This
      perspective explains how synaptic modifications or abnormal activity at
      one node can have network-wide effects. A future challenge is to define
      how the unique learning mechanisms at each network node interact to
      improve performance.

AB  - The Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) is considered as an anatomically and
      functionally heterogeneous region and is implicated in several functions.
      We propose that SMA plays a crucial role in domain-general sequence
      processes, contributing to the integration of sequential elements into
      higher-order representations regardless of the nature of such elements
      (e.g., motor, temporal, spatial, numerical, linguistic, etc.). This review
      emphasizes the domain-general involvement of the SMA, as this region has
      been found to support sequence operations in a variety of cognitive
      domains that, albeit different, share an inherent sequence processing.
      These include action, time and spatial processing, numerical cognition,
      music and language processing, and working memory. In this light, we
      reviewed and synthesized recent neuroimaging, stimulation and
      electrophysiological studies in order to compare and reconcile the
      distinct sources of data by proposing a unifying account for the role of
      the SMA. We also discussed the differential contribution of the pre-SMA
      and SMA-proper in sequence operations, and possible neural mechanisms by
      which such operations are executed.

AB  - We used retrograde transneuronal transport of neurotropic viruses in Cebus
      monkeys to examine the organization of basal ganglia and cerebellar
      projections to two cortical areas on the medial wall of the hemisphere,
      the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the pre-SMA. We found that both of
      these cortical areas are the targets of disynaptic projections from the
      dentate nucleus of the cerebellum and from the internal segment of the
      globus pallidus (GPi). On average, the number of pallidal neurons that
      project to the SMA and pre-SMA is approximately three to four times
      greater than the number of dentate neurons that project to these cortical
      areas. GPi neurons that project to the pre-SMA are located in a rostral,
      "associative" territory of the nucleus, whereas GPi neurons that project
      to the SMA are located in a more caudal and ventral "sensorimotor"
      territory. Similarly, dentate neurons that project to the pre-SMA are
      located in a ventral, "nonmotor" domain of the nucleus, whereas dentate
      neurons that project to the SMA are located in a more dorsal, "motor"
      domain. The differential origin of subcortical projections to the SMA and
      pre-SMA suggests that these cortical areas are nodes in distinct neural
      systems. Although both systems are the target of outputs from the basal
      ganglia and the cerebellum, these two cortical areas seem to be dominated
      by basal ganglia input.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A major question in understanding the functional organization
      of the brain is to delineate the functional divisions of the prefrontal
      cortex. Of particular importance to the cognitive capacities that are
      uniquely human is the fronto-polar cortex (Brodmann's area 10), which is
      disproportionally larger in humans relative to the rest of the brain than
      it is in the ape's brain. The specific function of this brain region
      remains poorly understood, but recent neuroimaging studies have proposed
      that it may hold goals in mind while exploring and processing secondary
      goals. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that the extent of damage to the
      fronto-polar cortex predicts impairment in the management of multiple
      goals. This result reveals that the integrity of the fronto-polar cortex
      is necessary to perform tasks that require subjects to maintain a primary
      goal in mind while processing secondary goals, an ability which is crucial
      for complex human cognitive abilities. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These
      results provide important new insights concerning the cerebral basis of
      complex human cognition such as planning and multitasking.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been shown that people can only maintain one problem
      state, or intermediate mental representation, at a time. When more than
      one problem state is required, for example in multitasking, performance
      decreases considerably. This effect has been explained in terms of a
      problem state bottleneck. METHODOLOGY: In the current study we use the
      complimentary methodologies of computational cognitive modeling and
      neuroimaging to investigate the neural correlates of this problem state
      bottleneck. In particular, an existing computational cognitive model was
      used to generate a priori fMRI predictions for a multitasking experiment
      in which the problem state bottleneck plays a major role. Hemodynamic
      responses were predicted for five brain regions, corresponding to five
      cognitive resources in the model. Most importantly, we predicted the
      intraparietal sulcus to show a strong effect of the problem state
      manipulations. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the predictions were confirmed by a
      subsequent fMRI experiment, while others were not matched by the data. The
      experiment supported the hypothesis that the problem state bottleneck is a
      plausible cause of the interference in the experiment and that it could be
      located in the intraparietal sulcus.

AB  - Cognitive flexibility forms the core of the extraordinary ability of
      humans to adapt, but the precise neural mechanisms underlying our ability
      to nimbly shift between task sets remain poorly understood. Recent
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies employing multivoxel
      pattern analysis (MVPA) have shown that a currently relevant task set can
      be decoded from activity patterns in the frontoparietal cortex, but
      whether these regions support the dynamic transformation of task sets from
      trial to trial is not clear. Here, we combined a cued task-switching
      protocol with human (both sexes) fMRI, and harnessed representational
      similarity analysis (RSA) to facilitate a novel assessment of
      trial-by-trial changes in neural task-set representations. We first used
      MVPA to define task-sensitive frontoparietal and visual regions and found
      that neural task-set representations on switch trials are less stably
      encoded than on repeat trials. We then exploited RSA to show that the
      neural representational pattern dissimilarity across consecutive trials is
      greater for switch trials than for repeat trials, and that the degree of
      this pattern dissimilarity predicts behavior. Moreover, the overall neural
      pattern of representational dissimilarities followed from the assumption
      that repeating sets, compared with switching sets, results in stronger
      neural task representations. Finally, when moving from cue to target phase
      within a trial, pattern dissimilarities tracked the transformation from
      previous-trial task representations to the currently relevant set. These
      results provide neural evidence for the longstanding assumptions of an
      effortful task-set reconfiguration process hampered by task-set inertia,
      and they demonstrate that frontoparietal and stimulus processing regions
      support "dynamic adaptive coding," flexibly representing changing task
      sets in a trial-by-trial fashion.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans can
      fluently switch between different tasks, reflecting an ability to
      dynamically configure "task sets," rule representations that link stimuli
      to appropriate responses. Recent studies show that neural signals in
      frontal and parietal brain regions can tell us which of two tasks a person
      is currently performing. However, it is not known whether these regions
      are also involved in dynamically reconfiguring task-set representations
      when switching between tasks. Here we measured human brain activity during
      task switching and tracked the similarity of neural task-set
      representations from trial to trial. We show that frontal and parietal
      brain regions flexibly recode changing task sets in a trial-by-trial
      fashion, and that task-set similarity over consecutive trials predicts
      behavior.

AB  - Anatomical investigations have revealed connections between the
      intralaminar thalamic nuclei and areas such as the superior colliculus
      (SC) that receive short latency input from visual and auditory primary
      sensory areas. The intralaminar nuclei in turn project to the major input
      nucleus of the basal ganglia, the striatum, providing this nucleus with a
      source of subcortical excitatory input. Together with a converging input
      from the cerebral cortex, and a neuromodulatory dopaminergic input from
      the midbrain, the components previously found necessary for reinforcement
      learning in the basal ganglia are present. With this intralaminar sensory
      input, the basal ganglia are thought to play a primary role in determining
      what aspect of an organism's own behavior has caused salient environmental
      changes. Additionally, subcortical loops through thalamic and basal
      ganglia nuclei are proposed to play a critical role in action selection.
      In this mini review we will consider the anatomical and physiological
      evidence underlying the existence of these circuits. We will propose how
      the circuits interact to modulate basal ganglia output and solve common
      behavioral learning problems of agency determination and action selection.

AB  - The basal ganglia are involved in sensorimotor functions and action
      selection, both of which require the integration of sensory information.
      In order to determine how such sensory inputs are integrated, we obtained
      whole-cell recordings in mouse dorsal striatum during presentation of
      tactile and visual stimuli. All recorded neurons responded to bilateral
      whisker stimulation, and a subpopulation also responded to visual
      stimulation. Neurons responding to both visual and tactile stimuli were
      located in dorsomedial striatum, whereas those responding only to whisker
      deflections were located dorsolaterally. Responses were mediated by
      overlapping excitation and inhibition, with excitation onset preceding
      that of inhibition by several milliseconds. Responses differed according
      to the type of neuron, with direct pathway MSNs having larger responses
      and longer latencies between ipsilateral and contralateral responses than
      indirect pathway MSNs. Our results suggest that striatum acts as a sensory
      "hub" with specialized functional roles for the different neuron types.

AB  - The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) has been implicated in perceptual
      decisions, but whether its role is specific to sensory processing or
      sensorimotor transformation is not well understood. Here, we trained mice
      to perform a go/no-go visual discrimination task and imaged the activity
      of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) and PPC during engaged behavior
      and passive viewing. Unlike V1 neurons, which respond robustly to stimuli
      in both conditions, most PPC neurons respond exclusively during task
      engagement. To test whether signals in PPC primarily encoded the stimulus
      or the animal's impending choice, we image the same neurons before and
      after re-training mice with a reversed sensorimotor contingency. Unlike V1
      neurons, most PPC neurons reflect the animal's choice of the new target
      stimulus after re-training. Mouse PPC is therefore strongly
      task-dependent, reflects choice more than stimulus, and may play a role in
      the transformation of visual inputs into motor commands.

AB  - Mapping specific sensory features to future motor actions is a crucial
      capability of mammalian nervous systems. We investigated the role of
      visual (V1), posterior parietal (PPC), and frontal motor (fMC) cortices
      for sensorimotor mapping in mice during performance of a memory-guided
      visual discrimination task. Large-scale calcium imaging revealed that V1,
      PPC, and fMC neurons exhibited heterogeneous responses spanning all task
      epochs (stimulus, delay, response). Population analyses demonstrated
      unique encoding of stimulus identity and behavioral choice information
      across regions, with V1 encoding stimulus, fMC encoding choice even early
      in the trial, and PPC multiplexing the two variables. Optogenetic
      inhibition during behavior revealed that all regions were necessary during
      the stimulus epoch, but only fMC was required during the delay and
      response epochs. Stimulus identity can thus be rapidly transformed into
      behavioral choice, requiring V1, PPC, and fMC during the transformation
      period, but only fMC for maintaining the choice in memory prior to
      execution.

AB  - Many organisms, especially humans, are characterized by their capacity for
      intentional, goal-directed actions. However, similar behaviours often

AB  - Decision making has recently emerged as a central theme in
      neurophysiological studies of cognition, and experimental and
      computational work has led to the proposal of a cortical circuit mechanism
      of elemental decision computations. This mechanism depends on slow
      recurrent synaptic excitation balanced by fast feedback inhibition, which
      not only instantiates attractor states for forming categorical choices but
      also long transients for gradually accumulating evidence in favor of or
      against alternative options. Such a circuit endowed with reward-dependent
      synaptic plasticity is able to produce adaptive choice behavior. While
      decision threshold is a core concept for reaction time tasks, it can be
      dissociated from a general decision rule. Moreover, perceptual decisions
      and value-based economic choices are described within a unified framework
      in which probabilistic choices result from irregular neuronal activity as
      well as iterative interactions of a decision maker with an uncertain
      environment or other unpredictable decision makers in a social group.

AB  - The basal ganglia are subcortical nuclei controlling voluntary actions and
      have been implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). The prevailing model of
      basal ganglia function states that two circuits, the direct and indirect
      pathways, originate from distinct populations of striatal medium spiny
      neurons (MSNs) and project to different output structures. These circuits
      are believed to have opposite effects on movement. Specifically, the
      activity of direct pathway MSNs is postulated to promote movement, whereas
      the activation of indirect pathway MSNs is hypothesized to inhibit it.
      Recent findings have revealed that this model might not fully account for
      the concurrent activation of both pathways during movement. Accordingly,
      we propose a model in which intrastriatal connections are critical and the
      two pathways are structurally and functionally intertwined. Thus, all MSNs
      might either facilitate or inhibit movement depending on the form of
      synaptic plasticity expressed at a certain moment. In PD, alterations of
      dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity could alter this coordinated
      activity.

AB  - The neuronal pathways that link sounds to rewarded actions remain elusive.
      For instance, it is unclear whether neurons in the posterior tail of the
      dorsal striatum (which receive direct input from the auditory system)
      mediate action selection, as other striatal circuits do. Here, we examine
      the role of posterior striatal neurons in auditory decisions in mice. We
      find that, in contrast to the anterior dorsal striatum, activation of the
      posterior striatum does not elicit systematic movement. However,
      activation of posterior striatal neurons during sound presentation in an
      auditory discrimination task biases the animals' choices, and transient
      inactivation of these neurons largely impairs sound discrimination.
      Moreover, the activity of these neurons during sound presentation reliably
      encodes stimulus features, but is only minimally influenced by the
      animals' choices. Our results suggest that posterior striatal neurons play
      an essential role in auditory decisions, and provides a stable
      representation of sounds during auditory tasks.

AB  - A large number of computational models of information processing in the
      basal ganglia have been developed in recent years. Prominent in these are
      actor-critic models of basal ganglia functioning, which build on the
      strong resemblance between dopamine neuron activity and the temporal
      difference prediction error signal in the critic, and between
      dopamine-dependent long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum and
      learning guided by a prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively
      review several actor-critic models of the basal ganglia with an emphasis
      on two important aspects: the way in which models of the critic reproduce
      the temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the extent to which models
      of the actor take into account known basal ganglia anatomy and physiology.
      To complement the efforts to relate basal ganglia mechanisms to
      reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce an alternative approach to
      modeling a critic network, which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques
      to 'evolve' an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the evolved mechanism to
      the basic model of the critic. We conclude our discussion of models of the
      critic by a critical discussion of the anatomical plausibility of
      implementations of a critic in basal ganglia circuitry, and conclude that
      such implementations build on assumptions that are inconsistent with the
      known anatomy of the basal ganglia. We return to the actor component of
      the actor-critic model, which is usually modeled at the striatal level
      with very little detail. We describe an alternative model of the basal
      ganglia which takes into account several important, and previously
      neglected, anatomical and physiological characteristics of basal
      ganglia-thalamocortical connectivity and suggests that the basal ganglia
      performs reinforcement-biased dimensionality reduction of cortical inputs.
      We further suggest that since such selective encoding may bias the
      representation at the level of the frontal cortex towards the selection of
      rewarded plans and actions, the reinforcement-driven dimensionality
      reduction framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia actor models.
      We conclude with a short discussion of the dual role of the dopamine
      signal in RL and in behavioral switching.

AB  - Recent fMRI studies suggest that the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS) is
      involved in the coordination of interfering processes in dual-task
      situations. The present study aims to further specify this assumption by
      investigating whether the compatibility between stimulus and response
      modalities modulates dual-task-related activity along the IFS. It has been
      shown behaviorally that the degree of interference, as measured by
      dual-task costs, increases in modality-incompatible conditions (e.g.
      visual-vocal tasks combined with auditory-manual tasks) as compared to
      modality-compatible conditions (e.g. visual-manual tasks combined with
      auditory-vocal tasks). Using fMRI, we measured IFS activity when
      participants performed modality-compatible and modality-incompatible
      single and dual tasks. Behaviorally, we replicated the finding of higher
      dual-task costs for modality-incompatible tasks compared to
      modality-compatible tasks. The fMRI data revealed higher activity along
      the IFS in modality-incompatible dual tasks compared with
      modality-compatible dual tasks when inter-individual variability in
      functional brain organization is taken into account. We argue that in
      addition to temporal order coordination (Szameitat et al., 2002), the IFS
      is involved in the coordination of cognitive processes associated with the
      concurrent mapping of sensory information onto corresponding motor
      responses in dual-task situations.

AB  - Frontoparietal cortex is thought to be essential for flexible behavior,
      but the mechanism for control remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate a
      potentially critical property of this cortex: its dynamic configuration
      for coding of task-critical information. Using multivoxel pattern analysis
      of human functional imaging data, we demonstrate an adaptive change in the
      patterns of activation coding task-relevant stimulus distinctions. When
      task demands made perceptual information more difficult to discriminate,
      frontoparietal regions showed increased coding of this information. Visual
      cortices showed the opposite result: a weaker representation of perceptual
      information in line with the physical change in the stimulus. On a longer
      timescale, a rebalancing of coding was also seen after practice, with a
      diminished representation of task rules as they became familiar. The
      results suggest a flexible neural system, exerting cognitive control in a
      wide range of tasks by adaptively representing the task features most
      challenging for successful goal-directed behavior.

AB  - The effects of practice on the functional anatomy observed in two
      different tasks, a verbal and a motor task, are reviewed in this paper. In
      the first, people practiced a verbal production task, generating an
      appropriate verb in response to a visually presented noun. Both practiced
      and unpracticed conditions utilized common regions such as visual and
      motor cortex. However, there was a set of regions that was affected by
      practice. Practice produced a shift in activity from left frontal,
      anterior cingulate, and right cerebellar hemisphere to activity in
      Sylvian-insular cortex. Similar changes were also observed in the second
      task, a task in a very different domain, namely the tracing of a maze.
      Some areas were significantly more activated during initial unskilled
      performance (right premotor and parietal cortex and left cerebellar
      hemisphere); a different region (medial frontal cortex, "supplementary
      motor area") showed greater activity during skilled performance
      conditions. Activations were also found in regions that most likely
      control movement execution irrespective of skill level (e.g., primary
      motor cortex was related to velocity of movement). One way of interpreting
      these results is in a "scaffolding-storage" framework. For unskilled,
      effortful performance, a scaffolding set of regions is used to cope with
      novel task demands. Following practice, a different set of regions is
      used, possibly representing storage of particular associations or
      capabilities that allow for skilled performance. The specific regions used
      for scaffolding and storage appear to be task dependent.

AB  - The human brain exhibits fundamental limitations in multitasking. When
      subjects engage in a primary task, their ability to respond to a second
      stimulus is degraded. Two competing models of multitasking have been
      proposed: either cognitive resources are shared between tasks, or they are
      allocated to each task serially. Using a novel combination of
      magneto-encephalography and multivariate pattern analyses, we obtained a
      precise spatio-temporal decomposition of the brain processes at work
      during multitasking. We discovered that each task relies on a sequence of
      brain processes. These sequences can operate in parallel for several
      hundred milliseconds but beyond ∼ 500 ms, they repel each other: processes
      evoked by the first task are shortened, while processes of the second task
      are either lengthened or postponed. These results contradict the
      resource-sharing model and further demonstrate that the serial model is
      incomplete. We therefore propose a new theoretical framework for the
      computational architecture underlying multitasking.

AB  - Despite the impressive complexity and processing power of the human brain,
      it is severely capacity limited. Behavioral research has highlighted three
      major bottlenecks of information processing that can cripple our ability
      to consciously perceive, hold in mind, and act upon the visual world,
      illustrated by the attentional blink (AB), visual short-term memory
      (VSTM), and psychological refractory period (PRP) phenomena, respectively.
      A review of the neurobiological literature suggests that the capacity
      limit of VSTM storage is primarily localized to the posterior parietal and
      occipital cortex, whereas the AB and PRP are associated with partly
      overlapping fronto-parietal networks. The convergence of these two
      networks in the lateral frontal cortex points to this brain region as a
      putative neural locus of a common processing bottleneck for perception and
      action.

AB  - The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) region is uniquely situated at the
      intersection of visual, somatosensory, and auditory association cortices,
      ideally located for processing of multisensory attention. We examined the
      internal architecture of the IPS region and its connectivity to other
      regions in the dorsal attention and cinguloinsular networks using maximal
      connectivity clustering. We show with resting state fMRI data from 58
      healthy adolescent and young adult volunteers that points of maximal
      connectivity between the IPS and other regions in the dorsal attention and
      cinguloinsular networks are topographically organized, with at least seven
      maps of the IPS region in each hemisphere. Distinct clusters of the IPS
      exhibited differential connectivity to auditory, visual, somatosensory,
      and default mode networks, suggesting local specialization within the IPS
      region for different sensory modalities. In an independent task activation
      paradigm with 16 subjects, attention to different sensory modalities
      showed similar functional specialization within the left intraparietal
      sulcus region. The default mode network, in contrast, did not show a
      topographical relationship between regions in the network, but rather
      maximal connectivity in each region to a single central cluster of the
      other regions. The topographical architecture of multisensory attention
      may represent a mechanism for specificity in top-down control of attention
      from dorsolateral prefrontal and lateral orbitofrontal cortex and may
      represent an organizational unit for multisensory representations in the
      brain.

AB  - In macaque monkeys, the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is concerned with
      the integration of multimodal information for constructing a spatial
      representation of the external world (in relation to the macaque's body or
      parts thereof), and planning and executing object-centred movements. The
      areas within the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), in particular, serve as
      interfaces between the perceptive and motor systems for controlling arm
      and eye movements in space. We review here the latest evidence for the
      existence of the IPS areas AIP (anterior intraparietal area), VIP (ventral
      intraparietal area), MIP (medial intraparietal area), LIP (lateral
      intraparietal area) and CIP (caudal intraparietal area) in macaques, and
      discuss putative human equivalents as assessed with functional magnetic
      resonance imaging. The data suggest that anterior parts of the IPS
      comprising areas AIP and VIP are relatively well preserved across species.
      By contrast, posterior areas such as area LIP and CIP have been found more
      medially in humans, possibly reflecting differences in the evolution of
      the dorsal visual stream and the inferior parietal lobule. Despite
      interspecies differences in the precise functional anatomy of the IPS
      areas, the functional relevance of this sulcus for visuomotor tasks
      comprising target selections for arm and eye movements, object
      manipulation and visuospatial attention is similar in humans and macaques,
      as is also suggested by studies of neurological deficits (apraxia,
      neglect, Bálint's syndrome) resulting from lesions to this region.

AB  - The psychological refractory period (PRP) refers to the fact that humans
      typically cannot perform two tasks at once. Behavioral experiments have
      led to the proposal that, in fact, peripheral perceptual and motor stages
      continue to operate in parallel, and that only a central decision stage
      imposes a serial bottleneck. We tested this model using neuroimaging
      methods combined with innovative time-sensitive analysis tools. Subjects
      performed a dual-task visual-auditory paradigm in which a delay of 300 ms
      was injected into the auditory task either within or outside of the
      dual-task interference period. Event-related potentials indicated that the
      first approximately 250 ms of processing were insensitive to dual-task
      interference, and that the PRP was mainly reflected in a delayed global
      component. By a clustering analysis based on time-resolved functional
      magnetic resonance imaging, we identified networks with qualitatively
      different timing properties: sensory areas tracked the objective time of
      stimulus presentation, a bilateral parietoprefrontal network correlated
      with the PRP delay, and an extended bilateral network that included
      bilateral posterior parietal cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor
      area, anterior part of the insula, and cerebellum was shared by both tasks
      during the extent of dual-task performance. The results provide
      physiological evidence for the coexistence of serial and parallel
      processes within a cognitive task.

AB  - The lateral prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia are known to be
      important for response selection processes, also in dual-task situations.
      However, response selection in dual-task situations can be achieved using
      different modes ranging from a parallel selection to a more serial
      selection of responses. Nothing is known whether differences in these
      processing modes during dual-tasking have distinct functional
      neuroanatomical correlates. In this fMRI study we analyzed performance in
      a psychological refractory period paradigm. In this paradigm we design a
      PRP task where we vary the frequency of short and long stimulus onset
      asynchronies between the two tasks. Using mathematical constraints we
      interpret the effects of this manipulation with respect to processing
      modes ranging from more serial to more parallel response selection.
      Contrastingly these blocks showed that response selection in dual-tasking
      under the constraint of more parallel processing is mediated by mechanisms
      operating at the striatal level, while response selection under the
      constraint of more serial processing is mediated via mechanisms operating
      in the lateral prefrontal cortex. The results suggest that lateral
      prefrontal and striatal regions are 'optimized' for a certain processing
      modes in dual tasking.

AB  - Human information processing is characterized by bottlenecks that
      constrain throughput. These bottlenecks limit both what we can perceive
      and what we can act on in multitask settings. Although perceptual and
      response limitations are often attributed to independent information
      processing bottlenecks, it has recently been suggested that a common
      attentional limitation may be responsible for both. To date, however,
      evidence supporting the existence of such a "unified" bottleneck has been
      mixed. Here, we tested the unified bottleneck hypothesis using
      time-resolved fMRI. Experiment 1 isolated brain regions involved in the
      response selection bottleneck that limits speeded dual-task performance.
      These same brain regions were not only engaged by a perceptual encoding
      task in Experiment 2, their activity also tracked delays to a speeded
      decision-making task caused by concurrent perceptual encoding (Experiment
      3). We conclude that a unified attentional bottleneck, including the
      inferior frontal junction, superior medial frontal cortex, and bilateral
      insula, temporally limits operations as diverse as perceptual encoding and
      decision-making.

AB  - We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the
      psychological refractory period (PRP), the delay in the response to the
      second of two tasks occurring in immediate succession. Our results were
      consistent with prior work on the PRP in that when two visual-manual tasks
      were presented within 100 ms of each other, the second response was
      delayed on the order of 500 ms, compared with when the two tasks were
      separated by 1,500 ms. Surprisingly, in brain regions postulated to be
      important for executive functions, there was virtually no increase in
      brain activation in the short-interval compared with the long-interval
      condition. These data suggest that passive queuing, rather than active
      monitoring, occurs during the PRP.

AB  - A crucial demand in dual tasks suffering from a capacity limited
      processing mechanism is task-order scheduling, i.e. the control of the
      order in which the two component tasks are processed by this limited
      processing mechanism. The present study aims to test whether the lateral
      prefrontal cortex (LPFC) is associated with this demand. For this, 15
      participants performed a psychological refractory paradigm (PRP) type dual
      task in an event-related functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) experiment.
      In detail, two choice reaction tasks, a visual (response with right hand)
      and an auditory (response with left hand), were presented with a temporal
      offset of 200 ms, while the participants were required to respond to the
      tasks in the order of their presentation. Importantly, the presentation
      order of the tasks changed randomly. Based on previous evidence, we argue
      that trials in which the present task order changed as compared to the
      previous trial (different-order trials) impose higher demands on task
      coordination than same-order trials do. The analyses showed that cortical
      areas along the posterior part of the left inferior frontal sulcus as well
      as the right posterior middle frontal gyrus were more strongly activated
      in different-order than in same-order trials, thus supporting the
      conclusion that one function of the LPFC for dual-task performance is the
      temporal coordination of two tasks. Furthermore, it is discussed that the
      present findings favour the active scheduling over the passive queuing
      hypothesis of dual-task processing.

AB  - We report a study that investigated the neuroanatomical correlates of
      executive functions in dual-task performance with functional magnetic
      resonance imaging. Participants performed an auditory and a visual
      three-choice reaction task either separately as single tasks or
      concurrently as dual tasks. In the dual-task condition, two stimuli were
      presented in rapid succession to ensure interference between the component
      tasks (psychological refractory period). The behavioral data showed
      considerable performance decrements in the dual-task compared to the
      single-task condition. Dual-task-related activation was detected with two
      different neuroimaging methods. First, we determined dual-task-related
      activation according to the method of cognitive subtraction. For that
      purpose, activation in the dual-task was compared directly with activation
      in the single-task conditions. This analysis revealed that cortical areas
      along the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), the middle frontal gyrus (MFG),
      and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) are involved in dual-task performance.
      The results of the subtraction method were validated with the method of
      parametric manipulation. For this purpose, a second dual-task condition
      was introduced, where the difficulty of the dual-task coordination was
      increased compared with the first dual-task condition. As expected,
      behavioral dual-task performance decreased with increased dual-task
      difficulty. Furthermore, the increased dual-task difficulty led to an
      increase of activation in those cortical regions that proved to be
      dual-task related with the subtraction method, that is, the IFS, the MFG,
      and the IPS. These results support the conclusion that dorsolateral
      prefrontal and superior parietal cortices are involved in the coordination
      of concurrent and interfering task processing.

AB  - It is difficult to perform two tasks at the same time. Such performance
      limitations are exemplified by the psychological refractory period (PRP):
      when participants make distinct motor responses to two stimuli presented
      in rapid succession, the response to the second stimulus is increasingly
      slowed as the time interval between the two stimuli is decreased. This
      impairment is thought to reflect a central limitation in selecting the
      appropriate response to each stimulus, but not in perceptually encoding
      the stimuli. In the present study, it was sought to determine which brain
      regions are specifically involved in response selection under dual-task
      conditions by contrasting fMRI brain activity measured from a response
      selection manipulation that increased dual-task costs, with brain activity
      measured from an equally demanding manipulation that affected perceptual
      visibility. While a number of parieto-frontal areas involved in response
      selection were activated by both dual-task manipulations, the dorsal
      pre-motor cortex, and to a lesser extent the inferior frontal cortex, were
      specifically engaged by the response selection manipulation. These results
      suggest that the pre-motor cortex is an important neural locus of response
      selection limitation under dual-task situations.

AB  - Subcortical loops through the basal ganglia and the cerebellum form
      computationally powerful distributed processing modules (DPMs). This paper
      relates the computational features of a DPM's loop through the basal
      ganglia to experimental results for two kinds of natural action selection.
      First, functional imaging during a serial order recall task was used to
      study human brain activity during the selection of sequential actions from
      working memory. Second, microelectrode recordings from monkeys trained in
      a step-tracking task were used to study the natural selection of
      corrective submovements. Our DPM-based model assisted in the
      interpretation of puzzling data from both of these experiments. We come to
      posit that the many loops through the basal ganglia each regulate the
      embodiment of pattern formation in a given area of cerebral cortex. This
      operation serves to instantiate different kinds of action (or thought)
      mediated by different areas of cerebral cortex. We then use our findings
      to formulate a model of the aetiology of schizophrenia.

AB  - The basal ganglia (BG) have long been implicated in both motor function
      and dysfunction. It has been proposed that the BG form a centralized
      action selection circuit, resolving conflict between multiple neural
      systems competing for access to the final common motor pathway. We present
      a new spiking neuron model of the BG circuitry to test this proposal,
      incorporating all major features and many physiologically plausible
      details. We include the following: effects of dopamine in the subthalamic
      nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GP), transmission delays between
      neurons, and specific distributions of synaptic inputs over dendrites. All
      main parameters were derived from experimental studies. We find that the
      BG circuitry supports motor program selection and switching, which
      deteriorates under dopamine-depleted and dopamine-excessive conditions in
      a manner consistent with some pathologies associated with those dopamine
      states. We also validated the model against data describing oscillatory
      properties of BG. We find that the same model displayed detailed features
      of both gamma-band (30-80 Hz) and slow (approximately 1 Hz) oscillatory
      phenomena reported by Brown et al. (2002) and Magill et al. (2001),
      respectively. Only the parameters required to mimic experimental
      conditions (e.g., anesthetic) or manipulations (e.g., lesions) were
      changed. From the results, we derive the following novel predictions about
      the STN-GP feedback loop: (1) the loop is functionally decoupled by tonic
      dopamine under normal conditions and recoupled by dopamine depletion; (2)
      the loop does not show pacemaking activity under normal conditions in vivo
      (but does after combined dopamine depletion and cortical lesion); (3) the
      loop has a resonant frequency in the gamma-band.

AB  - The study of decision making spans such varied fields as neuroscience,
      psychology, economics, statistics, political science, and computer
      science. Despite this diversity of applications, most decisions share
      common elements including deliberation and commitment. Here we evaluate
      recent progress in understanding how these basic elements of decision
      formation are implemented in the brain. We focus on simple decisions that

AB  - We recorded the activity of single neurons in the posterior parietal
      cortex (area LIP) of two rhesus monkeys while they discriminated the
      direction of motion in random-dot visual stimuli. The visual task was
      similar to a motion discrimination task that has been used in previous
      investigations of motion-sensitive regions of the extrastriate cortex. The
      monkeys were trained to decide whether the direction of motion was toward
      one of two choice targets that appeared on either side of the random-dot
      stimulus. At the end of the trial, the monkeys reported their direction
      judgment by making an eye movement to the appropriate target. We studied
      neurons in LIP that exhibited spatially selective persistent activity
      during delayed saccadic eye movement tasks. These neurons are thought to
      carry high-level signals appropriate for identifying salient visual
      targets and for guiding saccadic eye movements. We arranged the motion
      discrimination task so that one of the choice targets was in the LIP
      neuron's response field (RF) while the other target was positioned well
      away from the RF. During motion viewing, neurons in LIP altered their
      firing rate in a manner that predicted the saccadic eye movement that the
      monkey would make at the end of the trial. The activity thus predicted the
      monkey's judgment of motion direction. This predictive activity began
      early in the motion-viewing period and became increasingly reliable as the
      monkey viewed the random-dot motion. The neural activity predicted the
      monkey's direction judgment on both easy and difficult trials (strong and
      weak motion), whether or not the judgment was correct. In addition, the
      timing and magnitude of the response was affected by the strength of the
      motion signal in the stimulus. When the direction of motion was toward the
      RF, stronger motion led to larger neural responses earlier in the
      motion-viewing period. When motion was away from the RF, stronger motion
      led to greater suppression of ongoing activity. Thus the activity of
      single neurons in area LIP reflects both the direction of an impending
      gaze shift and the quality of the sensory information that instructs such
      a response. The time course of the neural response suggests that LIP
      accumulates sensory signals relevant to the selection of a target for an
      eye movement.

AB  - The neural mechanism underlying simple perceptual decision-making in
      monkeys has been recently conceptualized as an integrative process in
      which sensory evidence supporting different response options accumulates
      gradually over time. For example, intraparietal neurons accumulate motion
      information in favor of a specific oculomotor choice over time. It is
      unclear, however, whether this mechanism generalizes to more complex
      decisions that are based on arbitrary stimulus-response associations. In a
      task requiring arbitrary association of visual stimuli (faces or places)
      with different actions (eye or hand-pointing movements), we found that
      activity of effector-specific regions in human posterior parietal cortex
      reflected the 'strength' of the sensory evidence in favor of the preferred
      response. These regions did not respond to sensory stimuli per se but
      integrated sensory evidence toward the decision outcome. We conclude that
      even arbitrary decisions can be mediated by sensory-motor mechanisms that
      are completely triggered by contextual stimulus-response associations.

AB  - During decision making, neurons in multiple brain regions exhibit
      responses that are correlated with decisions. However, it remains
      uncertain whether or not various forms of decision-related activity are
      causally related to decision making. Here we address this question by
      recording and reversibly inactivating the lateral intraparietal (LIP) and
      middle temporal (MT) areas of rhesus macaques performing a motion
      direction discrimination task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited firing rate
      patterns that directly resembled the evidence accumulation process posited
      to govern decision making, with strong correlations between their response
      fluctuations and the animal's choices. Neurons in area MT, in contrast,
      exhibited weak correlations between their response fluctuations and
      choices, and had firing rate patterns consistent with their sensory role
      in motion encoding. The behavioural impact of pharmacological inactivation
      of each area was inversely related to their degree of decision-related
      activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT profoundly impaired
      psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no measurable impact
      on decision-making performance, despite having silenced the very clusters
      that exhibited strong decision-related activity. Although LIP inactivation
      did not impair psychophysical behaviour, it did influence spatial
      selection and oculomotor metrics in a free-choice control task. The
      absence of an effect on perceptual decision making was stable over trials
      and sessions and was robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry,
      arguing against several forms of compensation. Thus, decision-related
      signals in LIP do not appear to be critical for computing perceptual
      decisions, and may instead reflect secondary processes. Our findings
      highlight a dissociation between decision correlation and causation,
      showing that strong neuron-decision correlations do not necessarily offer
      direct access to the neural computations underlying decisions.

AB  - It has been suggested that the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of
      macaques plays a fundamental role in sensorimotor decision-making. We
      examined the neural code in LIP at the level of individual spike trains
      using a statistical approach based on generalized linear models. We found
      that LIP responses reflected a combination of temporally overlapping task-
      and decision-related signals. Our model accounts for the detailed
      statistics of LIP spike trains and accurately predicts spike trains from
      task events on single trials. Moreover, we derived an optimal decoder for
      heterogeneous, multiplexed LIP responses that could be implemented in
      biologically plausible circuits. In contrast with interpretations of LIP
      as providing an instantaneous code for decision variables, we found that
      optimal decoding requires integrating LIP spikes over two distinct
      timescales. These analyses provide a detailed understanding of neural
      representations in LIP and a framework for studying the coding of
      multiplexed signals in higher brain areas.

AB  - The basal ganglia are implicated in a remarkable range of functions
      influencing emotion and cognition as well as motor behavior. Current
      models of basal ganglia function hypothesize that parallel limbic,
      associative, and motor cortico-basal ganglia loops contribute to this
      diverse set of functions, but little is yet known about how these loops
      operate and how their activities evolve during learning. To address these
      issues, we recorded simultaneously in sensorimotor and associative regions
      of the striatum as rats learned different versions of a conditional T-maze
      task. We found highly contrasting patterns of activity in these regions
      during task performance and found that these different patterns of
      structured activity developed concurrently, but with sharply different
      dynamics. Based on the region-specific dynamics of these patterns across
      learning, we suggest a working model whereby dorsomedial associative loops
      can modulate the access of dorsolateral sensorimotor loops to the control
      of action.

AB  - Habits are notoriously difficult to break and, if broken, are usually
      replaced by new routines. To examine the neural basis of these
      characteristics, we recorded spike activity in cortical and striatal habit
      sites as rats learned maze tasks. Overtraining induced a shift from
      purposeful to habitual behavior. This shift coincided with the activation
      of neuronal ensembles in the infralimbic neocortex and the sensorimotor
      striatum, which became engaged simultaneously but developed changes in
      spike activity with distinct time courses and stability. The striatum
      rapidly acquired an action-bracketing activity pattern insensitive to
      reward devaluation but sensitive to running automaticity. A similar
      pattern developed in the upper layers of the infralimbic cortex, but it
      formed only late during overtraining and closely tracked habit states.
      Selective optogenetic disruption of infralimbic activity during
      overtraining prevented habit formation. We suggest that learning-related
      spiking dynamics of both striatum and neocortex are necessary, as dual
      operators, for habit crystallization.

AB  - Learning new action sequences subserves a plethora of different abilities
      such as escaping a predator, playing the piano, or producing fluent
      speech. Proper initiation and termination of each action sequence is
      critical for the organization of behaviour, and is compromised in
      nigrostriatal disorders like Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. Using
      a self-paced operant task in which mice learn to perform a particular
      sequence of actions to obtain an outcome, we found neural activity in
      nigrostriatal circuits specifically signalling the initiation or the
      termination of each action sequence. This start/stop activity emerged
      during sequence learning, was specific for particular actions, and did not
      reflect interval timing, movement speed or action value. Furthermore,
      genetically altering the function of striatal circuits disrupted the
      development of start/stop activity and selectively impaired sequence
      learning. These results have important implications for understanding the
      functional organization of actions and the sequence initiation and
      termination impairments observed in basal ganglia disorders.

AB  - The human brain efficiently solves certain operations such as object
      recognition and categorization through a massively parallel network of
      dedicated processors. However, human cognition also relies on the ability
      to perform an arbitrarily large set of tasks by flexibly recombining
      different processors into a novel chain. This flexibility comes at the
      cost of a severe slowing down and a seriality of operations (100-500 ms
      per step). A limit on parallel processing is demonstrated in experimental
      setups such as the psychological refractory period (PRP) and the
      attentional blink (AB) in which the processing of an element either
      significantly delays (PRP) or impedes conscious access (AB) of a second,
      rapidly presented element. Here we present a spiking-neuron implementation
      of a cognitive architecture where a large number of local parallel
      processors assemble together to produce goal-driven behavior. The precise
      mapping of incoming sensory stimuli onto motor representations relies on a
      "router" network capable of flexibly interconnecting processors and
      rapidly changing its configuration from one task to another. Simulations
      show that, when presented with dual-task stimuli, the network exhibits
      parallel processing at peripheral sensory levels, a memory buffer capable
      of keeping the result of sensory processing on hold, and a slow serial
      performance at the router stage, resulting in a performance bottleneck.
      The network captures the detailed dynamics of human behavior during
      dual-task-performance, including both mean RTs and RT distributions, and
      establishes concrete predictions on neuronal dynamics during dual-task
      experiments in humans and non-human primates.

AB  - Two critical target stimuli (T1 and T2) were embedded in a stream of white
      letters shown on a black background, using a rapid serial visual
      presentation paradigm (RSVP, 100 msec/item). T1 was a red H or S; T2 was
      an X or a Y. Performance in a two-alternative discrimination on T2 was
      impaired when processing of T1 was required--a result often called an
      attentional blink (AB). In previous work, the response in Task1 has been
      an unspeeded and delayed response at the end of the trial. Three
      experiments compared performances in Task2 that depended on whether Task1
      required an unspeeded delayed response or a speeded immediate response. A
      larger AB was found when a speeded response was required. Furthermore, in
      the speeded conditions, faster responses in Task1 were associated with a
      smaller and shorter AB effect than were slower responses. The results show
      that manipulations affecting a relatively late stage of
      processing--response selection--affect the magnitude and duration of the
      AB phenomenon. A new central inhibition theory is proposed to account for
      these results. According to this theory, the AB is similar to the
      psychological refractory period effect and is caused by central
      postponement of short-term consolidation of T2.

AB  - The abilities to select appropriate responses and suppress unwanted
      actions are key executive functions that enable flexible and goal-directed
      behavior. However, to date it has been unclear whether these two cognitive
      operations tap a common action control resource or reflect two distinct
      processes. In the present study, we used an individual differences
      approach to examine the underlying relationships across seven paradigms
      that varied in their response selection and response inhibition
      requirements: stop-signal, go-no-go, Stroop, flanker, single-response
      selection, psychological refractory period, and attentional blink tasks. A
      confirmatory factor analysis suggested that response inhibition and
      response selection are separable, with stop-signal and go-no-go task
      performance being related to response inhibition, and performance in the
      psychological refractory period, Stroop, single-response selection, and
      attentional blink tasks being related to response selection. These
      findings provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that response
      selection and response inhibition reflect two distinct cognitive
      operations.

AB  - Attention is strongly influenced by both external stimuli and internal
      goals. However, this useful dichotomy does not readily capture the
      ubiquitous and often automatic contribution of past experience stored in
      memory. We review recent evidence about how multiple memory systems
      control attention, consider how such interactions are manifested in the
      brain, and highlight how this framework for 'memory-guided attention'
      might help systematize previous findings and guide future research.

AB  - Although the performance of simple cognitive tasks can be enhanced if an
      incentive is provided, the mechanisms enabling such motivational control
      are not known. This study sought to uncover how mechanisms of attention
      and readiness are altered by reward-associated incentive stimuli. We
      measured EEG/ERP activity as human adults viewed a high- or low-incentive
      cue, experienced a short preparation interval, and then performed a simple
      visual search task to gain the predicted reward. Search performance was
      faster with high versus low incentives, and this was accompanied by
      distinct incentive-related EEG/ERP patterns at each phase of the task
      (incentive, preparation, and search). First, and most surprisingly,
      attention to high but not low incentive cues was actively suppressed, as
      indexed by a PD component in response to the incentive display. During the
      subsequent preparation interval, neural oscillations in the alpha
      frequency range were reduced after high-incentive cues, indicating
      heightened visual readiness. Finally, attentional orienting to the target
      in the search array was deployed with relatively little effort on
      high-incentive trials, as indexed by a reduced N2pc component. These
      results reveal the chain of events by which the brain's executive control
      mechanisms respond to incentives by altering the operation of multiple
      processing systems to produce optimal performance.

AB  - There is general agreement that both motivation and cognitive control play
      critical roles in shaping goal-directed behavior, but only recently has
      scientific interest focused around the question of motivation-control
      interactions. Here we briefly survey this literature, organizing
      contemporary findings around three issues: 1) whether motivation
      preferentially impacts cognitive control processes, 2) the neural
      mechanisms that underlie motivation-cognition interactions, and 3) why
      motivation might be relevant for overcoming the costs of control. Dopamine
      (DA) is discussed as a key neuromodulator in these motivation-cognition
      interactions. We conclude by highlighting open issues, specifically
      Pavlovian versus instrumental control distinctions and effects of
      motivational valence and conflict, which could benefit from future
      research attention.

AB  - The structure of the neocortex varies across the neocortical mantle to
      govern the physical size of principal neurons. What impact such anatomical
      variation has on the computational operations of principal neurons remains
      unknown. Here, we demonstrate within a functionally defined area that
      neocortical thickness governs the anatomical, electrophysiological, and
      computational properties of the principal output neurons of the neocortex.
      We find that neocortical thickness and the size of layer 5B pyramidal
      neurons changes as a gradient across the rostro-caudal axis of the rat
      primary visual cortex. Simultaneous somato-dendritic whole-cell recordings
      and compartmental modeling revealed that the electrical architecture of
      principal neurons was not preserved; rather, primary visual cortex
      site-dependent differences in intracellular resistivity accentuated a
      gradient of the electrical behavior of layer 5B pyramidal neurons to
      influence the emergence of active dendritic computations. Our findings
      therefore reveal an exquisite relationship between neocortical structure
      and neuronal computation.

      a special focus on pontine-geniculate-occipital waves and what they might
      tell us about the functional anatomy of sleep and consciousness. In
      particular, we review established ideas about the nature and purpose of
      sleep in terms of protoconsciousness and free energy minimization. By
      combining these theoretical perspectives, we discover answers to some
      fundamental questions about sleep: for example, why is homeothermy
      suspended during sleep? Why is sleep necessary? Why are we not surprised
      by our dreams? What is the role of synaptic regression in sleep? The
      imperatives for sleep that emerge also allow us to speculate about the
      functional role of PGO waves and make some empirical predictions that can,
      in principle, be tested using recent advances in the modeling of
      electrophysiological data.

AB  - Bayesian model selection (BMS) is a powerful method for determining the
      most likely among a set of competing hypotheses about the mechanisms that
      generated observed data. BMS has recently found widespread application in
      neuroimaging, particularly in the context of dynamic causal modelling
      (DCM). However, so far, combining BMS results from several subjects has
      relied on simple (fixed effects) metrics, e.g. the group Bayes factor
      (GBF), that do not account for group heterogeneity or outliers. In this
      paper, we compare the GBF with two random effects methods for BMS at the
      between-subject or group level. These methods provide inference on
      model-space using a classical and Bayesian perspective respectively.
      First, a classical (frequentist) approach uses the log model evidence as a
      subject-specific summary statistic. This enables one to use analysis of
      variance to test for differences in log-evidences over models, relative to
      inter-subject differences. We then consider the same problem in Bayesian
      terms and describe a novel hierarchical model, which is optimised to
      furnish a probability density on the models themselves. This new
      variational Bayes method rests on treating the model as a random variable
      and estimating the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution which describes
      the probabilities for all models considered. These probabilities then
      define a multinomial distribution over model space, allowing one to
      compute how likely it is that a specific model generated the data of a
      randomly chosen subject as well as the exceedance probability of one model
      being more likely than any other model. Using empirical and synthetic
      data, we show that optimising a conditional density of the model
      probabilities, given the log-evidences for each model over subjects, is
      more informative and appropriate than both the GBF and frequentist tests
      of the log-evidences. In particular, we found that the hierarchical
      Bayesian approach is considerably more robust than either of the other
      approaches in the presence of outliers. We expect that this new random
      effects method will prove useful for a wide range of group studies, not
      only in the context of DCM, but also for other modelling endeavours, e.g.
      comparing different source reconstruction methods for EEG/MEG or selecting
      among competing computational models of learning and decision-making.

AB  - Although regions within the medial frontal cortex are known to be active
      during voluntary movements their precise role remains unclear. Here we
      combine functional imaging localisation with psychophysics to demonstrate
      a strikingly selective contralesional impairment in the ability to inhibit
      ongoing movement plans in a patient with a rare lesion involving the right
      pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), but sparing the supplementary
      motor area (SMA). We find no corresponding delay in simple reaction times,
      and show that the inhibitory deficit is sensitive to the presence of
      competition between responses. The findings demonstrate that the pre-SMA
      plays a critical role in exerting control over voluntary actions in
      situations of response conflict. We discuss these findings in the context
      of a unified framework of pre-SMA function, and explore the degree to
      which extant data on this region can be explained by this function alone.

AB  - Human decision-making almost always takes place under time pressure. When
      people are engaged in activities such as shopping, driving, or playing
      chess, they have to continually balance the demands for fast decisions
      against the demands for accurate decisions. In the cognitive sciences,
      this balance is thought to be modulated by a response threshold, the
      neural substrate of which is currently subject to speculation. In a speed
      decision-making experiment, we presented participants with cues that
      indicated different requirements for response speed. Application of a
      mathematical model for the behavioral data confirmed that cueing for speed
      lowered the response threshold. Functional neuroimaging showed that cueing
      for speed activates the striatum and the pre-supplementary motor area
      (pre-SMA), brain structures that are part of a closed-loop motor circuit
      involved in the preparation of voluntary action plans. Moreover,
      activation in the striatum is known to release the motor system from
      global inhibition, thereby facilitating faster but possibly premature
      actions. Finally, the data show that individual variation in the
      activation of striatum and pre-SMA is selectively associated with
      individual variation in the amplitude of the adjustments in the response
      threshold estimated by the mathematical model. These results demonstrate
      that when people have to make decisions under time pressure their striatum
      and pre-SMA show increased levels of activation.

TI  - Lateralized suppression of alpha-band EEG activity as a mechanism of
      target processing
T2  - J. Neurosci.
PY  - 2018
DA  - 2018/12/6
AB  - Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) activity has been linked
      to visual attention since the earliest EEG studies. More recent studies
      using spatial cuing paradigms have shown that alpha is suppressed over the
      hemisphere contralateral to a to-be-attended location, suggesting that
      alpha serves as a mechanism of preparatory attention. Here, we demonstrate
      that alpha also plays a role in active target processing. EEG activity was
      recorded from a group of healthy male and female human subjects in two
      visual search experiments. In addition to alpha activity, we also assessed
      the N2pc event-related potential component, a lateralized transient EEG
      response that has been tightly linked with the focusing of attention on
      visual targets. We found that the visual search targets triggered both an
      N2pc component and a suppression of alpha-band activity that was greatest
      over the hemisphere contralateral to the target (which we call
      target-elicited lateralized alpha suppression or TELAS). In Experiment 1,
      both N2pc and TELAS were observed for targets presented in the lower
      visual field but were absent for upper-field targets. However, these two
      lateralized effects had different time courses, and they responded
      differently to manipulations of crowding in Experiment 2. These results
      indicate that lateralized alpha-band activity is involved in active target
      processing and is not solely a preparatory mechanism, and they further
      indicate that TELAS and N2pc reflect related but separable neural
      mechanism of visuospatial attention.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe very first
      EEG studies demonstrated that alpha-band (8-12 Hz) EEG oscillations are
      suppressed when people attend to visual information, and more recent
      research has shown that cuing an individual to expect a target at a
      specific location produces lateralized suppression in the contralateral
      hemisphere. Thus, lateralized alpha may serve as a preparatory mechanism.
      In the present study, we found that a similar lateralized alpha effect is
      triggered by the appearance of a visual target even though the location
      could not be anticipated, demonstrating that alpha also serves as an
      active mechanism of target processing. Moreover, we found that alpha
      lateralization can be dissociated from other lateralized measures of
      target selection, indicating that it reflects a distinct mechanism of
      attention.

      analysis
T2  - bioRxiv
PY  - 2018

Y2  - 2019/1/24
AB  - Morlet wavelets are frequently used for time-frequency analysis of
      non-stationary time series data, such as neuroelectrical signals recorded
      from the brain. The crucial parameter of Morlet wavelets is the width of
      the Gaussian that tapers the sine wave. This width parameter controls the
      trade-off between temporal precision and frequency precision. It is
      typically defined as the "number of cycles," but this parameter is opaque,
      and often leads to uncertainty and suboptimal analysis choices, as well as
      being difficult to interpret and evaluate. The purpose of this paper is to
      present alternative formulations of Morlet wavelets in time and in
      frequency that allow parameterizing the wavelets directly in terms of the
      desired temporal and spectral smoothing (as full-width at half-maximum).
      This formulation provides clarity on an important data analysis parameter,
      and should facilitate proper analyses, reporting, and interpretation of

AB  - We examined visual search for color singleton targets, whose shape was
      discriminated. Critically, we varied the reward priority of singleton
      colors (correct fast performance was worth more bonus points for red
      singletons than for green singletons, or vice versa) to test whether
      event-related potential signatures of visual selection can be affected by
      distinct reward priorities for different target types, even when every
      target has to be selected for report. The N2pc component was earlier and
      larger for high- than for low-reward targets. This influence of reward on
      the N2pc correlated with the subject-by-subject impact of reward level on
      efficiency of behavioral performance. Later postselection processing was
      also affected by reward level. These results demonstrate that visual
      selection of task-relevant items is rapidly modulated by reward-related
      priorities, even when every target has to be selected for response.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of an abstract motivational incentive on top-down
      mechanisms of visual spatial attention, 10 subjects engaged in a target
      detection task and responded to targets preceded by spatially valid
      (predictive), invalid (misleading) or neutral central cues under three
      different incentive conditions: win money (WIN), lose money (LOSE), and
      neutral (neither gain nor lose). Activation in the posterior cingulate
      cortex was correlated with visual spatial expectancy, defined as the
      degree to which the valid cue benefited performance as evidenced by faster
      reaction times compared to non-directional cues. Winning and losing money
      enhanced this relationship via overlapping but independent limbic
      mechanisms. In addition, activity in the inferior parietal lobule was
      correlated with disengagement (the degree to which invalid cues diminished
      performance). This relationship was also enhanced by monetary incentives.
      Finally, incentive enhanced the relationship of activation in the visual
      cortex to visual spatial expectancy and disengagement for both types of
      incentive (WIN and LOSE). These results show that abstract incentives
      enhance neural processing within the attention network in a process- and
      valence-selective manner. They also show that different cognitive and
      motivational mechanisms may produce a common effect upon unimodal cortices
      in order to enhance processing to serve the current behavioral goal.

AB  - Despite considerable interest in the neural basis of valuation, the
      question of how valuation affects cognitive processing has received
      relatively less attention. Here, we review evidence from recent behavioral
      and neuroimaging studies supporting the notion that motivation can enhance
      perceptual and executive control processes to achieve more efficient
      goal-directed behavior. Specifically, in the context of cognitive tasks
      offering monetary gains, improved behavioral performance has been
      repeatedly observed in conjunction with elevated neural activations in
      task-relevant perceptual, cognitive and reward-related regions. We address
      the neural basis of motivation-cognition interactions by suggesting
      various modes of communication between relevant neural networks: (1)
      global hub regions may integrate information from multiple inputs
      providing a communicative link between specialized networks; (2)
      point-to-point interactions allow for more specific cross-network
      communication; and (3) diffuse neuromodulatory systems can relay
      motivational signals to cortex and enhance signal processing. Together,
      these modes of communication allow information regarding motivational
      significance to reach relevant brain regions and shape behavior.

AB  - This study investigated how sample size affects the reproducibility of
      findings from univariate voxel-based lesion-deficit analyses (e.g.,
      voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping and voxel-based morphometry). Our
      effect of interest was the strength of the mapping between brain damage
      and speech articulation difficulties, as measured in terms of the
      proportion of variance explained. First, we identified a region of
      interest by searching on a voxel-by-voxel basis for brain areas where
      greater lesion load was associated with poorer speech articulation using a
      large sample of 360 right-handed English-speaking stroke survivors. We
      then randomly drew thousands of bootstrap samples from this data set that
      included either 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, or 360 patients. For each resample,
      we recorded effect size estimates and p values after conducting exactly
      the same lesion-deficit analysis within the previously identified region
      of interest and holding all procedures constant. The results show (1) how
      often small effect sizes in a heterogeneous population fail to be
      detected; (2) how effect size and its statistical significance varies with
      sample size; (3) how low-powered studies (due to small sample sizes) can
      greatly over-estimate as well as under-estimate effect sizes; and (4) how
      large sample sizes (N ≥ 90) can yield highly significant p values even
      when effect sizes are so small that they become trivial in practical
      terms. The implications of these findings for interpreting the results
      from univariate voxel-based lesion-deficit analyses are discussed.

AB  - Many visual tasks can be decomposed into a sequence of simpler subtasks.
      Ullman suggested that such subtasks are carried out by elemental
      operations that are implemented by specialized processes in the visual
      brain [Ullman, S. (1984). Visual routines. Cognition (18), 97–159].
      According to this hypothesis, there are a limited number of elemental
      operations that, since they can be applied sequentially, may nevertheless
      give rise to a large number of visual routines. Examples of such elemental
      operations are visual search, texture segregation and contour grouping.
      Here we attempt to delineate how such elemental operations are implemented
      in the visual brain. When an image appears, feedforward processing rapidly
      leads to an activity pattern that is distributed across many visual areas.
      Thereafter, elemental operations come into play, and these are implemented
      by the modulation of firing rates. Firing rate modulations effectuate
      grouping of neural responses into coherent object representations.
      Moreover, they permit transfer of information from one operator to the
      next, which allows flexibility in the sequencing of operations. We discuss
      how the elemental operations provide a tool to relate cortical physiology
      to psychophysics, and suggest a reclassification of pre-attentive and
      attentive processes.

AB  - Attentional selection shapes human perception, enhancing relevant
      information, according to behavioral goals. Here, we used multivariate
      decoding of electrophysiological brain responses (MEG/EEG) to examine
      real-time representation of the component processes of selective
      attention. Auditory cues instructed participants to respond to a
      particular visual target, embedded within a stream of single- and
      multi-item displays. Although the task logically required items to be
      compared to an attentional "template", signals consistent with such a
      template were relatively weak and appeared to transition through a
      quiescent state. Subsequent stimulus processing evoked strong neural
      representation of multiple target features, evolving over different
      timescales. Combining single and multi-item displays with different types
      of distractors allowed quantification of various components of attention.
      Following a visual choice display, we observed five distinguishable
      processing operations with different time-courses. First, visual
      properties of the stimulus were strongly represented. Second, the location
      of the candidate target was rapidly represented in multi-item displays,
      providing the earliest evidence of modulation by behavioral relevance.
      Third, there was enhanced representation of the candidate target,
      including its identity, relative to distractors. Fourth, only later was
      the behavioral significance of the target explicitly represented in
      single-item displays. Finally, if the target was not identified and search
      was to be resumed, then an attentional template was weakly reactivated.
      The observation that an item9s behavioral relevance directs attention in
      multi-item displays prior to explicit representation of target/non-target
      status in single-item displays is consistent with two-stage models of
      attention.

AB  - A detailed description of the simultaneous type, serial token (ST2) model
      is presented. ST2 is a model of temporal attention and working memory that
      encapsulates 5 principles: (a) M. M. Chun and M. C. Potter's (1995)
      2-stage model, (b) a Stage 1 salience filter, (c) N. G. Kanwisher's (1987,
      1991) types-tokens distinction, (d) a transient attentional enhancement,
      and (e) a mechanism for associating types with tokens called the binding
      pool. The authors instantiate this theoretical position in a connectionist
      implementation, called neural-ST2, which they illustrate by modeling
      temporal attention results focused on the attentional blink (AB). They
      demonstrate that the ST2 model explains a spectrum of AB findings.
      Furthermore, they highlight a number of new temporal attention predictions
      arising from the ST2 theory, which are tested in a series of behavioral
      experiments. Finally, the authors review major AB models and theories and
      compare them with ST2.

AB  - When the distance between a visual target and nearby flankers falls below
      a critical distance, target discrimination declines precipitously. This is
      called "crowding." Many researchers have proposed that selective attention
      plays a role in crowding. However, although some research has examined the
      effects of directing attention toward versus away from the targets, no
      previous research has assessed how attentional allocation varies as a
      function of target-flanker distance in crowding. Here, we used ERPs to
      assess the operation of attention during crowding, focusing on the
      attention-related N2pc component. We used a typical crowding task in which
      participants were asked to report the category (vowel/consonant) of a
      lateralized target letter flanked by distractor letters at different
      distances. We tested the hypothesis that attention fails when the
      target-flanker distance becomes too small for attention to operate
      effectively. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that N2pc amplitude
      was maximal at intermediate target-flanker distances and decreased
      substantially when crowding became severe. In addition, we examined the
      sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), which reflects the
      amount of information being maintained in working memory. Unlike the N2pc
      component, the SPCN increased in amplitude at small target-flanker
      distances, suggesting that observers stored information about the target
      and flankers in working memory when attention failed to select the target.
      Together, the N2pc and SPCN results suggest that attention and working
      memory play distinctive roles in crowding: Attention operates to minimize
      interference from the flankers at intermediate target-flanker distances,
      whereas working memory may be recruited when attention fails to select the
      target at small target-flanker distances.

TI  - Preprint:The neglected contribution of memory encoding in spatial cueing:
      A new theory of costs and benefits
PY  - 2017
DA  - 2017/2
AB  - Spatial cueing is one of the most robust effects in cognitive psychology
      and has been thought for decades to indicate the resource limits of the
      visual attention system given that invalidly cued items are processed less
      efficiently than neutral ones. However, limited resource accounts cannot
      explain findings of dividing attention without yielding noticeable costs
      as well as findings showing benefits without costs in spatial cueing. The
      current study presents a new account of cueing effects, namely the memory
      encoding cost (MEC) theory, which integrates attention and memory encoding
      effects in an explanation of the costs and benefits evoked by a spatial
      cue. Unlike previous theories that focused only on the role of attention
      in yielding spatial cueing effects, the MEC theory argues that cueing
      effects are driven by two distinct mechanisms: attentional facilitation
      and a memory encoding cost. That is, the cost of an invalid cue as
      measured by target report is entirely or at least partially driven by
      memory encoding of the cue which extends across the entire visual field,
      while the benefit of a valid cue is the net effect of a combination of
      this encoding cost, and a spatiotopic attentional facilitation. The
      crucial implication of this theory is that attention may be unlimited
      despite the observation of invalidity costs. MEC generates a number of
      predictions that we test here, providing three convergent lines of
      evidence for such encoding costs in cueing paradigms. Furthermore, as the
      MEC suggests a common mechanism underlying cueing costs and the
      attentional blink, we simulated the core empirical findings of the current
      study by using an existing attentional blink model and found that the
      model was able to simulate them with manipulation of a single parameter
      that corresponds to memory encoding. The MEC theory thus simplifies our
      theoretical understanding of attentional effects by linking the
      attentional blink and spatial cueing costs to a common mechanism. The code
      and data for all of the reported experiments and simulations are available
      on the Open Science Framework at this URL:

TI  - Disentangling the Role of Cortico-Basal Ganglia Loops in Top-Down and
      Bottom-Up Visual Attention: An Investigation of Attention Deficits in
      Parkinson Disease

AB  - It is solidly established that top-down (goal-driven) and bottom-up
      (stimulus-driven) attention mechanisms depend on distributed cortical
      networks, including prefrontal and frontoparietal regions. On the other
      hand, it is less clear whether the BG also contribute to one or the other
      of these mechanisms, or to both. The current study was principally
      undertaken to clarify this issue. Parkinson disease (PD), a
      neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting the BG, has proven to be an
      effective model for investigating the contribution of the BG to different
      brain functions; therefore, we set out to investigate deficits of top-down
      and bottom-up attention in a selected cohort of PD patients. With this
      objective in mind, we compared the performance on three computerized tasks
      of two groups of 12 parkinsonian patients (assessed without any
      treatment), one otherwise pharmacologically treated and the other also
      surgically treated, with that of a group of controls. The main behavioral
      tool for our study was an attentional capture task, which enabled us to
      tap the competition between top-down and bottom-up mechanisms of visual
      attention. This task was suitably combined with a choice RT and a simple
      RT task to isolate any specific deficit of attention from deficits in
      motor response selection and initiation. In the two groups of patients, we
      found an equivalent increase of attentional capture but also comparable
      delays in target selection in the absence of any salient distractor
      (reflecting impaired top-down mechanisms) and movement initiation compared
      with controls. In contrast, motor response selection processes appeared to
      be prolonged only in the operated patients. Our results confirm that the
      BG are involved in both motor and cognitive domains. Specifically, damage
      to the BG, as it occurs in PD, leads to a distinct deficit of top-down
      control of visual attention, and this can account, albeit indirectly, for
      the enhancement of attentional capture, reflecting weakened ability of
      top-down mechanisms to antagonize bottom-up control.

AB  - Shifts of attention to unattended stimuli (stimulus-driven reorienting)
      are often studied by measuring responses to unexpected stimuli,
      confounding reorienting and expectation. We separately measured the
      blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal for both factors by manipulating
      the probability of salient visual cues that either shifted attention away
      from or maintained attention on a stream of visual stimuli. The results
      distinguished three networks recruited by reorienting. Right
      temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the posterior core of a ventral
      frontoparietal network, was activated more by cues for shifting than
      maintaining attention independently of cue location and probability,
      acting as a switch. TPJ was separately modulated by low probability cues,
      which signaled a breach of spatial expectation, independently of whether
      they shifted attention. Under resting conditions, TPJ activity was
      correlated [resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance
      imaging, (rs-fcMRI)] with right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), an anterior
      component of the ventral network. Nevertheless, IFG was activated only by
      unexpected shifts of attention, dissociating its function from TPJ. Basal
      ganglia and frontal/insula regions also were activated only when
      reorienting was unexpected but showed strong rs-fcMRI among themselves,
      not with TPJ/IFG, defining a distinct network that may retrieve/activate
      commands for shifting attention. Within dorsal frontoparietal regions,
      shifting attention produced sustained spatially selective modulations in
      intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and frontal-eye field (FEF), and transient less
      selective modulations in precuneus and FEF. Modulations were observed even
      when reorienting was likely, but increased when reorienting was
      unexpected. The latter result may partly reflect interactions with lateral
      prefrontal components of the basal-ganglia/frontal/insula network that
      showed significant rs-fcMRI with the dorsal network.

TI  - Hemispheric asymmetry of globus pallidus relates to alpha modulation in
      reward-related attentional tasks
T2  - bioRxiv
PY  - 2018
DA  - 2018/10/22
Y2  - 2019/3/7
AB  - While subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia (BG) have been
      widely explored in relation to motor control, recent evidence suggests
      that their mechanisms extend to the domain of attentional switching. We
      here investigated the subcortical involvement in reward related top-down
      control of visual alpha-band oscillations (8-13 Hz), which have been
      consistently linked to the mechanisms supporting the allocation of visual
      spatial attention. Given that items associated with contextual saliency
      (e.g. monetary reward or loss) attract attention, it is not surprising
      that alpha oscillations are further modulated by the saliency properties
      of the visual items. The executive network controlling such
      reward-dependent modulations of oscillatory brain activity has yet to be
      fully elucidated. Although it has been explored in terms of
      cortico-cortical interaction, such network likely relies also on the
      contribution of subcortical regions. To uncover this, we investigated
      whether derived measures of subcortical structural asymmetries could
      predict interhemispheric modulation of alpha power during a spatial
      attention task. We show that volumetric hemispheric lateralization of
      globus pallidus (GP) and thalamus (Th) explains individual hemispheric
      biases in the ability to modulate posterior alpha power. Importantly, for
      the GP, this effect became stronger when the value-saliency parings in the
      task increased. Our findings suggest that the Th and GP in humans are part
      of a subcortical executive control network, differently involved in
      modulating posterior alpha activity. Further investigation aimed at
      uncovering the interaction between subcortical and neocortical attentional
      networks would provide useful insight in future studies.

TI  - Independent circuits in basal ganglia and cortex for the processing of
      reward and precision feedback
T2  - Neuroimage
VL  - 162
SP  - 56-64
PY  - 2017
DA  - 2017/11/15
AB  - In order to understand human decision making it is necessary to understand
      how the brain uses feedback to guide goal-directed behavior. The ventral
      striatum (VS) appears to be a key structure in this function, responding
      strongly to explicit reward feedback. However, recent results have also
      shown striatal activity following correct task performance even in the
      absence of feedback. This raises the possibility that, in addition to
      processing external feedback, the dopamine-centered "reward circuit" might
      regulate endogenous reinforcement signals, like those triggered by
      satisfaction in accurate task performance. Here we use functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to test this idea. Participants completed a
      simple task that garnered both reward feedback and feedback about the
      precision of performance. Importantly, the design was such that we could
      manipulate information about the precision of performance within different
      levels of reward magnitude. Using parametric modulation and functional
      connectivity analysis we identified brain regions sensitive to each of
      these signals. Our results show a double dissociation: frontal and
      posterior cingulate regions responded to explicit reward but were
      insensitive to task precision, whereas the dorsal striatum - and putamen
      in particular - was insensitive to reward but responded strongly to
      precision feedback in reward-present trials. Both types of feedback
      activated the VS, and sensitivity in this structure to precision feedback
      was predicted by personality traits related to approach behavior and
      reward responsiveness. Our findings shed new light on the role of specific
      brain regions in integrating different sources of feedback to guide
      goal-directed behavior.

TI  - Correlated Components Analysis - Extracting Reliable Dimensions in
      Multivariate Data
T2  - arXiv [stat.ML]
PY  - 2018
DA  - 2018/1/26
AB  - How does one find dimensions in multivariate data that are reliably
      expressed across repetitions? For example, in a brain imaging study one
      may want to identify combinations of neural signals that are reliably
      expressed across multiple trials or subjects. For a behavioral assessment
      with multiple ratings, one may want to identify an aggregate score that is
      reliably reproduced across raters. Correlated Components Analysis (CorrCA)
      addresses this problem by identifying components that are maximally
      correlated between repetitions (e.g. trials, subjects, raters). Here we
      formalize this as the maximization of the ratio of between-repetition to
      within-repetition covariance. We show that this criterion maximizes
      repeat-reliability, defined as mean over variance across repeats, and that
      it leads to CorrCA or to multi-set Canonical Correlation Analysis,
      depending on the constraints. Surprisingly, we also find that CorrCA is
      equivalent to Linear Discriminant Analysis for zero-mean signals, which
      provides an unexpected link between classic concepts of multivariate
      analysis. We present an exact parametric test of statistical significance
      based on the F-statistic for normally distributed independent samples, and
      present and validate shuffle statistics for the case of dependent samples.
      Regularization and extension to non-linear mappings using kernels are also
      presented. The algorithms are demonstrated on a series of data analysis
      applications, and we provide all code and data required to reproduce the
      results.

AB  - Decision making is thought to be guided by the values of alternative
      options and involve the accumulation of evidence to an internal bound.
      However, in natural behavior, evidence accumulation is an active process
      whereby subjects decide when and which sensory stimulus to sample. These
      sampling decisions are naturally served by attention and rapid eye
      movements (saccades), but little is known about how saccades are
      controlled to guide future actions. Here we review evidence that was
      discussed at a recent symposium, which suggests that information selection
      involves basal ganglia and cortical mechanisms and that, across different
      contexts, it is guided by two central factors: the gains in reward and
      gains in information (uncertainty reduction) associated with sensory cues.

AB  - In natural behaviour, animals actively interrogate their environments
      using endogenously generated 'question-and-answer' strategies. However, in
      laboratory settings participants typically engage with externally imposed
      stimuli and tasks, and the mechanisms of active sampling remain poorly
      understood. We review a nascent neuroscientific literature that examines
      active-sampling policies and their relation to attention and curiosity. We
      distinguish between information sampling, in which organisms reduce
      uncertainty relevant to a familiar task, and information search, in which
      they investigate in an open-ended fashion to discover new tasks. We review
      evidence that both sampling and search depend on individual preferences
      over cognitive states, including attitudes towards uncertainty, learning
      progress and types of information. We propose that, although these
      preferences are non-instrumental and can on occasion interfere with
      external goals, they are important heuristics that allow organisms to cope
      with the high complexity of both sampling and search, and generate
      curiosity-driven investigations in large, open environments in which
      rewards are sparse and ex ante unknown.

AB  - How do you make a decision if you do not know the rules of the game?
      Models of sensory decision-making suggest that choices are slow if
      evidence is weak, but they may only apply if the subject knows the task
      rules. Here, we asked how the learning of a new rule influences neuronal
      activity in the visual (area V1) and frontal cortex (area FEF) of monkeys.
      We devised a new icon-selection task. On each day, the monkeys saw 2 new
      icons (small pictures) and learned which one was relevant. We rewarded eye
      movements to a saccade target connected to the relevant icon with a curve.
      Neurons in visual and frontal cortex coded the monkey's choice, because
      the representation of the selected curve was enhanced. Learning delayed
      the neuronal selection signals and we uncovered the cause of this delay in
      V1, where learning to select the relevant icon caused an early suppression
      of surrounding image elements. These results demonstrate that the learning
      of a new rule causes a transition from fast and random decisions to a more
      considerate strategy that takes additional time and they reveal the
      contribution of visual and frontal cortex to the learning process.

AB  - Neurons in early visual cortical areas not only represent incoming visual
      information but are also engaged by higher level cognitive processes,
      including attention, working memory, imagery, and decision-making. Are
      these cognitive effects an epiphenomenon or are they functionally relevant
      for these mental operations? We review evidence supporting the hypothesis
      that the modulation of activity in early visual areas has a causal role in
      cognition. The modulatory influences allow the early visual cortex to act
      as a multiscale cognitive blackboard for read and write operations by
      higher visual areas, which can thereby efficiently exchange information.
      This blackboard architecture explains how the activity of neurons in the
      early visual cortex contributes to scene segmentation and working memory,
      and relates to the subject's inferences about the visual world. The
      architecture also has distinct advantages for the processing of visual
      routines that rely on a number of sequentially executed processing steps.

      insights into learning in the brain. However, the methods used for deep
      learning by artificial neural networks are biologically unrealistic and
      would need to be replaced by biologically realistic counterparts. Previous
      biologically plausible reinforcement learning rules, like AGREL and
      AuGMEnT, showed promising results but focused on shallow networks with
      three layers. Will these learning rules also generalize to networks with
      more layers and can they handle tasks of higher complexity? Here, we
      demonstrate that these learning schemes indeed generalize to deep
      networks, if we include an attention network that propagates information
      about the selected action to lower network levels. The resulting learning
      rule, called Q-AGREL, is equivalent to a particular form of
      error-backpropagation that trains one output unit at any one time. To
      demonstrate the utility of the learning scheme for larger problems, we
      trained networks with two hidden layers on the MNIST dataset, a standard
      and interesting Machine Learning task. Our results demonstrate that the
      capability of Q-AGREL is comparable to that of error backpropagation,
      although the learning rate is 1.5-2 times slower because the network has
      to learn by trial-and-error and updates the action value of only one
      output unit at a time. Our results provide new insights into how deep
      learning can be implemented in the brain.

AB  - We can learn new tasks by listening to a teacher, but we can also learn by
      trial-and-error. Here, we investigate the factors that determine how
      participants learn new stimulus-response mappings by trial-and-error. Does
      learning in human observers comply with reinforcement learning theories,
      which describe how subjects learn from rewards and punishments? If yes,
      what is the influence of selective attention in the learning process? We
      developed a novel redundant-relevant learning paradigm to examine the
      conjoint influence of attention and reward feedback. We found that
      subjects only learned stimulus-response mappings for attended shapes, even
      when unattended shapes were equally informative. Reward magnitude also
      influenced learning, an effect that was stronger for attended than for
      non-attended shapes and that carried over to a subsequent visual search
      task. Our results provide insights into how attention and reward jointly
      determine how we learn. They support the powerful learning rules that
      capitalize on the conjoint influence of these two factors on neuronal
      plasticity.

AB  - Infant visual attention develops rapidly over the first year of life,
      significantly altering the way infants respond to peripheral visual
      events. Here we present data from 5-, 7- and 10-month-old infants using
      the Infant Orienting With Attention (IOWA) task, designed to capture
      developmental changes in visual spatial attention and saccade planning.
      Results indicate rapid development of spatial attention and visual
      response competition between 5 and 10 months. We use a dynamic neural
      field (DNF) model to link behavioral findings to neural population
      activity, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for observed
      developmental changes. Together, the behavioral and model simulation
      results provide new insights into the specific mechanisms that underlie
      spatial cueing effects, visual competition, and visual interference in
      infancy.

AB  - In humans and non-human primates, the parietal lobe plays a key role in
      spatial attention - the ability to extract information from regions of
      space. This role is thought to be mediated by "priority" maps that
      highlight attention-worthy locations, and provide top-down feedback for
      motor orienting and attentional allocation. Traditionally, priority
      signals within the parietal cortex have been characterized as being purely
      spatial, i.e., encoding the desired locus of gaze or attention regardless
      of the context in which the brain generates that selection. Here, we
      highlight evidence from human behavior and neuroimaging as well as monkey
      physiology, to argue that non-spatial responses are critical to the
      establishment of priority maps in parietal cortex. This review offers an
      integrative view of the role that parietal cortex plays in attentional
      selection, providing evidence that priority maps reflect spatial and
      non-spatial priorities that ultimately act on sensory information in a
      spatial way.

AB  - In natural behavior we actively gather information using attention and
      active sensing behaviors (such as shifts of gaze) to sample relevant cues.
      However, while attention and decision making are naturally coordinated, in
      the laboratory they have been dissociated. Attention is studied
      independently of the actions it serves. Conversely, decision theories make
      the simplifying assumption that the relevant information is given, and do
      not attempt to describe how the decision maker may learn and implement
      active sampling policies. In this paper I review recent studies that
      address questions of attentional learning, cue validity and information
      seeking in humans and non-human primates. These studies suggest that
      learning a sampling policy involves large scale interactions between
      networks of attention and valuation, which implement these policies based
      on reward maximization, uncertainty reduction and the intrinsic utility of
      cognitive states. I discuss the importance of using such paradigms for
      formalizing the role of attention, as well as devising more realistic
      theories of decision making that capture a broader range of empirical
      observations.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The deployment of visuospatial attention and the programming
      of saccades are governed by the inferred likelihood of events. In the
      present study, we combined computational modeling of psychophysical data
      with fMRI to characterize the computational and neural mechanisms
      underlying this flexible attentional control. Sixteen healthy human
      subjects performed a modified version of Posner's location-cueing paradigm
      in which the percentage of cue validity varied in time and the targets
      required saccadic responses. Trialwise estimates of the certainty
      (precision) of the prediction that the target would appear at the cued
      location were derived from a hierarchical Bayesian model fitted to
      individual trialwise saccadic response speeds. Trial-specific model
      parameters then entered analyses of fMRI data as parametric regressors.
      Moreover, dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was performed to identify the most
      likely functional architecture of the attentional reorienting network and
      its modulation by (Bayes-optimal) precision-dependent attention. While the
      frontal eye fields (FEFs), intraparietal sulcus, and temporoparietal
      junction (TPJ) of both hemispheres showed higher activity on invalid
      relative to valid trials, reorienting responses in right FEF, TPJ, and the
      putamen were significantly modulated by precision-dependent attention. Our
      DCM results suggested that the precision of predictability underlies the
      attentional modulation of the coupling of TPJ with FEF and the putamen.
      Our results shed new light on the computational architecture and neuronal
      network dynamics underlying the context-sensitive deployment of
      visuospatial attention. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Spatial attention and its
      neural correlates in the human brain have been studied extensively with
      the help of fMRI and cueing paradigms in which the location of targets is
      pre-cued on a trial-by-trial basis. One aspect that has so far been
      neglected concerns the question of how the brain forms attentional
      expectancies when no a priori probability information is available but
      needs to be inferred from observations. This study elucidates the
      computational and neural mechanisms under which probabilistic inference
      governs attentional deployment. Our results show that Bayesian belief
      updating explains changes in cortical connectivity; in that directional
      influences from the temporoparietal junction on the frontal eye fields and
      the putamen were modulated by (Bayes-optimal) updates.

AB  - Every-day decisions frequently require choosing among multiple
      alternatives. Yet, the optimal policy for such decisions is unknown. Here
      we derive the normative policy for general multi-alternative decisions.
      This strategy requires evidence accumulation to nonlinear, time-dependent
      bounds, that trigger choices. A geometric symmetry in those boundaries
      allows the optimal strategy to be implemented by a simple neural circuit
      involving a normalization with fixed decision bounds and an urgency
      signal. The model captures several key features of the response of
      decision-making neurons as well as the increase in reaction time as a
      function of the number of alternatives, known as Hick9s law. In addition,
      we show that, in the presence of divisive normalization and internal
      variability, our model can account for several so called 9irrational9
      behaviors such as the similarity effect as well as the violation of both
      the independent irrelevant alternative principle and the regularity
      principle.

Y2  - 2019/4/8
AB  - A quintessential challenge for any perceptual system is the need to focus
      on task-relevant information without being blindsided by unexpected, yet
      important information. The human visual system incorporates several
      solutions to this challenge, one of which is a reflexive covert attention
      system that is rapidly responsive to both the physical salience and the
      task-relevance of new information. This paper presents a model that
      simulates behavioral and neural correlates of reflexive attention as the
      product of brief neural attractor states that are formed across the visual
      hierarchy at the moment when attention is engaged. Such attractors emerge
      from an attentional gradient distributed over a population of
      topographically organized neurons and serve to focus processing at one or
      more locations in the visual field, while inhibiting the processing of
      lower priority information. The model resolves key debates about the
      nature of reflexive attention, such as whether it is parallel or serial,
      and whether suppression effects are distributed in a spatial surround, or
      selectively at the location of distractors. Most importantly, the model
      develops a framework for understanding the neural mechanisms of visual
      attention as a spatiotopic decision process within a hierarchy and links
      them to observable correlates such as accuracy, reaction time, and the
      N2pc and PD components of the EEG. This last contribution is the most
      crucial for repairing the disconnect that exists between our understanding
      of behavioral and neural correlates of attention.

AB  - Across scientific disciplines, there is a rapidly growing recognition of
      the need for more statistically robust, transparent approaches to data
      visualization. Complimentary to this, many scientists have realized the
      need for plotting tools that accurately and transparently convey key
      aspects of statistical effects and raw data with minimal distortion.
      Previously common approaches, such as plotting conditional mean or median
      barplots together with error-bars have been criticized for distorting
      effect size, hiding underlying patterns in the raw data, and obscuring the
      assumptions upon which the most commonly used statistical tests are based.
      Here we describe a data visualization approach which overcomes these
      issues, providing maximal statistical information while preserving the
      desired ‘inference at a glance’ nature of barplots and other similar
      visualization devices. These “raincloud plots” can visualize raw data,
      probability density, and key summary statistics such as median, mean, and
      relevant confidence intervals in an appealing and flexible format with
      minimal redundancy. In this tutorial paper we provide basic demonstrations
      of the strength of raincloud plots and similar approaches, outline
      potential modifications for their optimal use, and provide open-source
      code for their streamlined implementation in R, Python and Matlab (
      https://github.com/RainCloudPlots/RainCloudPlots ). Readers can
      investigate the R and Python tutorials interactively in the browser using

AB  - Because most rewarding events are probabilistic and changing, the
      extinction of probabilistic rewards is important for survival. It has been
      proposed that the extinction of probabilistic rewards depends on arousal
      and the amount of learning of reward values. Midbrain dopamine neurons
      were suggested to play a role in both arousal and learning reward values.
      Despite extensive research on modeling dopaminergic activity in reward
      learning (e.g. temporal difference models), few studies have been done on
      modeling its role in arousal. Although temporal difference models capture
      key characteristics of dopaminergic activity during the extinction of
      deterministic rewards, they have been less successful at simulating the
      extinction of probabilistic rewards. By adding an arousal signal to a
      temporal difference model, we were able to simulate the extinction of
      probabilistic rewards and its dependence on the amount of learning. Our
      simulations propose that arousal allows the probability of reward to have
      lasting effects on the updating of reward value, which slows the
      extinction of low probability rewards. Using this model, we predicted
      that, by signaling the prediction error, dopamine determines the learned
      reward value that has to be extinguished during extinction and
      participates in regulating the size of the arousal signal that controls
      the learning rate. These predictions were supported by pharmacological
      experiments in rats.

      automatically capture visual attention. Previous studies have examined the
      neural correlates of value-driven attentional orienting, revealing
      elevated activity within a network of brain regions encompassing the
      visual corticostriatal loop [caudate tail, lateral occipital complex (LOC)
      and early visual cortex] and intraparietal sulcus (IPS). Such attentional
      priority signals raise a broader question concerning how visual signals
      are combined with reward signals during learning to create a
      representation that is sensitive to the confluence of the two. This study
      examines reward signals during the cued reward training phase commonly
      used to generate value-driven attentional biases. High, compared with low,
      reward feedback preferentially activated the value-driven attention
      network, in addition to regions typically implicated in reward processing.
      Further examination of these reward signals within the visual system
      revealed information about the identity of the preceding cue in the
      caudate tail and LOC, and information about the location of the preceding
      cue in IPS, while early visual cortex represented both location and
      identity. The results reveal teaching signals within the value-driven
      attention network during associative reward learning, and further suggest
      functional specialization within different regions of this network during
      the acquisition of an integrated representation of stimulus value.

AB  - Objects that promise rewards are prioritized for visual selection. The way
      this prioritization shapes sensory processing in visual cortex, however,
      is debated. It has been suggested that rewards motivate stronger
      attentional focusing, resulting in a modulation of sensory selection in
      early visual cortex. An open question is whether those reward-driven
      modulations would be independent of similar modulations indexing the
      selection of attended features that are not associated with reward. Here,
      we use magnetoencephalography in human observers to investigate whether
      the modulations indexing global color-based selection in visual cortex are
      separable for target- and (monetary) reward-defining colors. To assess the
      underlying global color-based activity modulation, we compare the
      event-related magnetic field response elicited by a color probe in the
      unattended hemifield drawn either in the target color, the reward color,
      both colors, or a neutral task-irrelevant color. To test whether target
      and reward relevance trigger separable modulations, we manipulate
      attention demands on target selection while keeping reward-defining
      experimental parameters constant. Replicating previous observations, we
      find that reward and target relevance produce almost indistinguishable
      gain modulations in ventral extratriate cortex contralateral to the
      unattended color probe. Importantly, increasing attention demands on
      target discrimination increases the response to the target-defining color,
      whereas the response to the rewarded color remains largely unchanged.
      These observations indicate that, although task relevance and reward
      influence the very same feature-selective area in extrastriate visual
      cortex, the associated modulations are largely independent.

AB  - In order to learn efficiently, organisms must learn how to distribute
      their attention to the available cues. Traditionally, most experiments on
      attention learning have involved discrete outcomes (e.g. no food vs. one
      food pellet, or category A vs. category B). A basic finding is that cues
      receive attention in proportion to how well they predict such outcomes.
      However, more recent research has shown an apparently independent effect
      of outcome value on attention (Le Pelley, Mitchell, & Johnson, 2013}, in
      which cues associated with large rewards receive more attention than those
      associated with small rewards. It has been suggested that a separate
      derived attention mechanism - in which attention is based directly on
      association strength - is necessary to explain this result (Le Pelley,
      Mitchell, Beesley, George, & Wills, 2016). As our primary experimental
      contribution, we use modified versions of this design to replicate the
      value effect and show that it can be reversed by manipulating the rewards
      given for incorrect choices. Our simulations show that CompAct - a model
      in which cues compete for attention on the basis of their relative
      predictiveness - can account for both of our empirical results. The
      derived attention theory, in contrast, incorrectly predicts that cues
      associated with large rewards will always receive more attention. We
      conclude that we do not need separate mechanisms to account for
      predictiveness effects and value effects on attention.

AB  - Perception and perceptual decision-making are strongly facilitated by
      prior knowledge about the probabilistic structure of the world. While the
      computational benefits of using prior expectation in perception are clear,
      there are myriad ways in which this computation can be realized. We review
      here recent advances in our understanding of the neural sources and
      targets of expectations in perception. Furthermore, we discuss Bayesian
      theories of perception that prescribe how an agent should integrate prior
      knowledge and sensory information, and investigate how current and future
      empirical data can inform and constrain computational frameworks that
      implement such probabilistic integration in perception.

AB  - How does the brain combine information predictive of the value of a
      visually guided task (incentive value) with information predictive of
      where task relevant stimuli may occur (spatial certainty)? Human
      behavioural evidence indicates that these two predictions are combined
      additively to bias visual selection (additive hypothesis), whereas
      neuroeconomic studies posit that they may be multiplicatively combined
      (expected value hypothesis). We sought to arbitrate between these two
      alternatives, and to test the possibility that both operations are
      available to visual prioritization mechanisms, but that their use is
      context dependent (mixed operations hypothesis). Participants viewed two
      coloured placeholders that specified the potential value of correctly
      identifying an imminent letter target if it appeared in that placeholder.
      Then, prior to the target9s presentation, an endogenous spatial cue was
      presented indicating the target9s more likely location. Spatial cues were
      parametrically manipulated with regard to the information gained (in
      bits). Across two experiments, response time and accuracy were greater for
      targets appearing in high versus low value placeholders and higher when
      targets appeared in validly cued locations, even under conditions designed
      to impinge the optimality of an additive operation. Interestingly, these
      factors did not interact; Bayesian model selection showed that the
      additive hypothesis clearly outperformed the expected value and mixed
      operations hypotheses in accounting for the observed data from both
      experiments. These findings refute theories that expected value
      computations are the singular mechanism driving the deployment of
      endogenous spatial attention. Instead, incentive value and spatial
      certainty seem to act independently to influence visual selection.

AB  - Attentional orientation to a spatial cue and reorientation-after invalid
      cueing-are mediated by two distinct networks in the human brain. A
      bilateral dorsal frontoparietal network, comprising the intraparietal
      sulcus (IPS) and the frontal eye fields (FEF), controls the voluntary
      deployment of attention and may modulate visual cortex in preparation for
      upcoming stimulation. In contrast, reorienting attention to invalidly cued
      targets engages a right-lateralized ventral frontoparietal network
      comprising the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and ventral frontal cortex.
      The present fMRI study investigated the functional architecture of these
      two attentional systems by characterizing effective connectivity during
      lateralized orienting and reorienting of attention, respectively. Subjects
      performed a modified version of Posner's location-cueing paradigm. Dynamic
      causal modeling (DCM) of regional responses in the dorsal and ventral
      network, identified in a conventional (SPM) whole-brain analysis, was used
      to compare different functional architectures. Bayesian model selection
      showed that top-down connections from left and right IPS to left and right
      visual cortex, respectively, were modulated by the direction of attention.
      Moreover, model evidence was highest for a model with directed influences
      from bilateral IPS to FEF, and reciprocal coupling between right and left
      FEF. Invalid cueing enhanced forward connections from visual areas to
      right TPJ, and directed influences from right TPJ to right IPS and IFG
      (inferior frontal gyrus). These findings shed further light on the
      functional organization of the dorsal and ventral attentional network and
      support a context-sensitive lateralization in the top-down (backward)
      mediation of attentional orienting and the bottom-up (forward) effects of
      invalid cueing.

AB  - In recent years there has been a significant commercial interest in 'brain
      training' - massed or spaced practice on a small set of tasks to boost
      cognitive performance. Recently, researchers have combined cognitive
      training regimes with brain stimulation to try and maximize training
      benefits, leading to task-specific cognitive enhancement. It remains
      unclear, however, whether the performance gains afforded by such regimes
      can transfer to untrained tasks, or how training and stimulation affect
      the brain's latent information processing dynamics. To examine these
      issues, we applied transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the
      prefrontal cortex while participants undertook decision-making training
      over several days. Anodal, relative to cathodal/sham tDCS, increased
      performance gains from training. Critically, these gains were reliable for
      both trained and untrained tasks. The benefit of anodal tDCS occurred for
      left, but not right, prefrontal stimulation, and was absent for
      stimulation delivered without concurrent training. Modeling revealed left
      anodal stimulation combined with training caused an increase in the
      brain's rate of evidence accumulation for both tasks. Thus tDCS applied
      during training has the potential to modulate training gains and give rise
      to transferable performance benefits for distinct cognitive operations
      through an increase in the rate at which the brain acquires information.

AB  - Humans show large and reliable performance impairments when required to
      make more than one simple decision simultaneously. Such multitasking costs
      are thought to largely reflect capacity limits in response selection
      (Welford, 1952; Pashler, 1984, 1994), the information processing stage at
      which sensory input is mapped to a motor response. Neuroimaging has
      implicated the left posterior lateral prefrontal cortex (pLPFC) as a key
      neural substrate of response selection (Dux et al., 2006, 2009; Ivanoff et
      al., 2009). For example, activity in left pLPFC tracks improvements in
      response selection efficiency typically observed following training (Dux
      et al., 2009). To date, however, there has been no causal evidence that
      pLPFC contributes directly to sensory-motor training effects, or the
      operations through which training occurs. Moreover, the left hemisphere
      lateralization of this operation remains controversial (Jiang and
      Kanwisher, 2003; Sigman and Dehaene, 2008; Verbruggen et al., 2010). We
      used anodal (excitatory), cathodal (inhibitory), and sham transcranial
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) to left and right pLPFC and measured
      participants' performance on high and low response selection load tasks
      after different amounts of training. Both anodal and cathodal stimulation
      of the left pLPFC disrupted training effects for the high load condition
      relative to sham. No disruption was found for the low load and right pLPFC
      stimulation conditions. The findings implicate the left pLPFC in both
      response selection and training effects. They also suggest that training
      improves response selection efficiency by fine-tuning activity in pLPFC
      relating to sensory-motor translations.

AB  - Selective attention is reflected neurally in changes in the power of
      posterior neural oscillations in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and gamma (40-100 Hz)
      bands. Although a neural mechanism that allows relevant information to be
      selectively processed has its advantages, it may lead to lucrative or
      dangerous information going unnoticed. Neural systems are also in place
      for processing rewarding and punishing information. Here, we examine the
      interaction between selective attention (left vs. right) and stimulus's
      learned value associations (neutral, punished, or rewarded) and how they
      compete for control of posterior neural oscillations. We found that both
      attention and stimulus-value associations influenced neural oscillations.
      Whereas selective attention had comparable effects on alpha and gamma
      oscillations, value associations had dissociable effects on these neural
      markers of attention. Salient targets (associated with positive and
      negative outcomes) hijacked changes in alpha power-increasing hemispheric
      alpha lateralization when salient targets were attended, decreasing it
      when they were being ignored. In contrast, hemispheric gamma-band
      lateralization was specifically abolished by negative distractors. Source
      analysis indicated occipital generators of both attentional and value
      effects. Thus, posterior cortical oscillations support both the ability to
      selectively attend while at the same time retaining the ability to remain
      sensitive to valuable features in the environment. Moreover, the
      versatility of our attentional system to respond separately to salient
      from merely positively valued stimuli appears to be carried out by
      separate neural processes reflected in different frequency bands.

AB  - We have developed a toolbox and graphic user interface, EEGLAB, running
      under the crossplatform MATLAB environment (The Mathworks, Inc.) for
      processing collections of single-trial and/or averaged EEG data of any
      number of channels. Available functions include EEG data, channel and
      event information importing, data visualization (scrolling, scalp map and
      dipole model plotting, plus multi-trial ERP-image plots), preprocessing
      (including artifact rejection, filtering, epoch selection, and averaging),
      independent component analysis (ICA) and time/frequency decompositions
      including channel and component cross-coherence supported by bootstrap
      statistical methods based on data resampling. EEGLAB functions are
      organized into three layers. Top-layer functions allow users to interact
      with the data through the graphic interface without needing to use MATLAB
      syntax. Menu options allow users to tune the behavior of EEGLAB to
      available memory. Middle-layer functions allow users to customize data
      processing using command history and interactive 'pop' functions.
      Experienced MATLAB users can use EEGLAB data structures and stand-alone
      signal processing functions to write custom and/or batch analysis scripts.

AB  - ERPLAB toolbox is a freely available, open-source toolbox for processing
      and analyzing event-related potential (ERP) data in the MATLAB
      environment. ERPLAB is closely integrated with EEGLAB, a popular
      open-source toolbox that provides many EEG preprocessing steps and an
      excellent user interface design. ERPLAB adds to EEGLAB's EEG processing
      functions, providing additional tools for filtering, artifact detection,
      re-referencing, and sorting of events, among others. ERPLAB also provides
      robust tools for averaging EEG segments together to create averaged ERPs,
      for creating difference waves and other recombinations of ERP waveforms
      through algebraic expressions, for filtering and re-referencing the
      averaged ERPs, for plotting ERP waveforms and scalp maps, and for
      quantifying several types of amplitudes and latencies. ERPLAB's tools can
      be accessed either from an easy-to-learn graphical user interface or from
      MATLAB scripts, and a command history function makes it easy for users
      with no programming experience to write scripts. Consequently, ERPLAB
      provides both ease of use and virtually unlimited power and flexibility,
      making it appropriate for the analysis of both simple and complex ERP
      experiments. Several forms of documentation are available, including a
      detailed user's guide, a step-by-step tutorial, a scripting guide, and a
      set of video-based demonstrations.

AB  - A crucial question for the analysis of multi-subject and/or multi-session
      electroencephalographic (EEG) data is how to combine information across
      multiple recordings from different subjects and/or sessions, each
      associated with its own set of source processes and scalp projections.
      Here we introduce a novel statistical method for characterizing the
      spatial consistency of EEG dynamics across a set of data records. Measure
      Projection Analysis (MPA) first finds voxels in a common template brain
      space at which a given dynamic measure is consistent across nearby source
      locations, then computes local-mean EEG measure values for this voxel
      subspace using a statistical model of source localization error and
      between-subject anatomical variation. Finally, clustering the mean measure
      voxel values in this locally consistent brain subspace finds brain spatial
      domains exhibiting distinguishable measure features and provides 3-D maps
      plus statistical significance estimates for each EEG measure of interest.
      Applied to sufficient high-quality data, the scalp projections of many
      maximally independent component (IC) processes contributing to recorded
      high-density EEG data closely match the projection of a single equivalent
      dipole located in or near brain cortex. We demonstrate the application of
      MPA to a multi-subject EEG study decomposed using independent component
      analysis (ICA), compare the results to k-means IC clustering in EEGLAB
      (sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), and use surrogate data to test MPA robustness. A
      Measure Projection Toolbox (MPT) plug-in for EEGLAB is available for
      download (sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/MPT). Together, MPA and ICA allow use of EEG
      as a 3-D cortical imaging modality with near-cm scale spatial resolution.

AB  - In this paper, we frame the strategy and motivations behind developments
      in statistical parametric mapping (SPM) for the analysis of
      electroencephalogram (EEG) data. This work deals specifically with SPM
      procedures for the analysis of event-related potentials (ERP). We place
      these developments in the larger context of integrating
      electrophysiological and hemodynamic measurements of evoked brain
      responses through the fusion of EEG and fMRI data. In this paper, we
      consider some fundamental issues when selecting an appropriate statistical
      model that enables diverse questions to be asked of the data and at the
      same time retains maximum sensitivity. The three key issues addressed in
      this paper are as follows: (i) should multivariate or mass univariate
      analyses be adopted, (ii) should time be treated as an experimental factor
      or as a dimension of the measured response variable, and (iii) how to form
      appropriate explanatory variables in a hierarchical observation model. We
      review the relative merits of the different options and explain the
      rationale for our choices. In brief, we motivate a mass univariate
      approach in terms of sensitivity to region-specific responses. This
      involves modeling responses at each voxel or space bin separately. In
      contradistinction, we treat time as an experimental factor to enable
      inferences about temporally distributed responses that encompass multiple
      time bins. In a companion paper, we develop statistical models of ERPs in
      the time domain that follow from the heuristics established here and
      illustrate the approach using simulated and real data.

AB  - We describe a Bayesian estimation and inference procedure for fMRI time
      series based on the use of General Linear Models (GLMs). Importantly, we
      use a spatial prior on regression coefficients which embodies our prior
      knowledge that evoked responses are spatially contiguous and locally
      homogeneous. Further, using a computationally efficient Variational Bayes
      framework, we are able to let the data determine the optimal amount of
      smoothing. We assume an arbitrary order Auto-Regressive (AR) model for the
      errors. Our model generalizes earlier work on voxel-wise estimation of
      GLM-AR models and inference in GLMs using Posterior Probability Maps
      (PPMs). Results are shown on simulated data and on data from an
      event-related fMRI experiment.

T2  - Cortex
VL  - 102
SP  - 107-120
PY  - 2018
DA  - 2018/5
AB  - Recent research has expanded the list of factors that control spatial
      attention. Beside current goals and perceptual salience, statistical
      learning, reward, motivation and emotion also affect attention. But do
      these various factors influence spatial attention in the same manner, as
      suggested by the integrated framework of attention, or do they target
      different aspects of spatial attention? Here I present evidence that the
      control of attention may be implemented in two ways. Whereas current goals
      typically modulate where in space attention is prioritized, search habits
      affect how one moves attention in space. Using the location probability
      learning paradigm, I show that a search habit forms when people frequently
      find a visual search target in one region of space. Attentional cuing by
      probability learning differs from that by current goals. Probability cuing
      is implicit and persists long after the probability cue is no longer
      valid. Whereas explicit goal-driven attention codes space in an
      environment-centered reference frame, probability cuing is viewer-centered
      and is insensitive to secondary working memory load and aging. I propose a
      multi-level framework that separates the source of attentional control
      from its implementation. Similar to the integrated framework, the
      multi-level framework considers current goals, perceptual salience, and
      selection history as major sources of attentional control. However, these
      factors are implemented in two ways, controlling where spatial attention
      is allocated and how one shifts attention in space.

DA  - 2013/6/7
AB  - Visual selective attention is the brain function that modulates ongoing
      processing of retinal input in order for selected representations to gain
      privileged access to perceptual awareness and guide behavior. Enhanced
      analysis of currently relevant or otherwise salient information is often
      accompanied by suppressed processing of the less relevant or salient
      input. Recent findings indicate that rewards exert a powerful influence on
      the deployment of visual selective attention. Such influence takes
      different forms depending on the specific protocol adopted in the given
      study. In some cases, the prospect of earning a larger reward in relation
      to a specific stimulus or location biases attention accordingly in order
      to maximize overall gain. This is mediated by an effect of reward acting
      as a type of incentive motivation for the strategic control of attention.
      In contrast, reward delivery can directly alter the processing of specific
      stimuli by increasing their attentional priority, and this can be measured
      even when rewards are no longer involved, reflecting a form of
      reward-mediated attentional learning. As a further development, recent
      work demonstrates that rewards can affect attentional learning in
      dissociable ways depending on whether rewards are perceived as feedback on
      performance or instead are registered as random-like events occurring
      during task performance. Specifically, it appears that visual selective
      attention is shaped by two distinct reward-related learning mechanisms:
      one requiring active monitoring of performance and outcome, and a second
      one detecting the sheer association between objects in the environment
      (whether attended or ignored) and the more-or-less rewarding events that
      accompany them. Overall this emerging literature demonstrates
      unequivocally that rewards "teach" visual selective attention so that
      processing resources will be allocated to objects, features and locations
      which are likely to optimize the organism's interaction with the
      surrounding environment and maximize positive outcome.

AB  - Test targets ('singletons') that displayed orientation, motion, luminance,
      or color contrast, or pairwise combinations of these, were presented in
      line texture arrays, and their saliences were quantified in comparison to
      reference targets at defined luminance levels. In general, saliency
      effects in different stimulus dimensions did add, but did not add
      linearly. That is, targets with feature contrast in two dimensions were
      generally more salient than targets with only one of these properties, but
      often less salient than predicted from the sum of the individual saliency
      components. Salience variations within a dimension were compared with and
      without a second saliency effect added. The resulting gain reduction in
      the combined stimulus conditions was interpreted to reflect the amount of
      overlap between the respective saliency mechanisms. Combinations of
      orientation and color contrast produced the strongest gain reduction
      (about 90% for color in orientation) thus indicating the strongest overlap
      of underlying saliency mechanisms. Combinations of orientation and motion
      contrast revealed about 50% overlap, slightly smaller rates were found for
      combinations of color and motion. All combinations with luminance contrast
      (orientation and luminance, motion and luminance) produced only little
      gain reduction (<30%) thus indicating a higher degree of independence
      between the underlying saliency mechanisms than for other stimulus
      dimensions.

AB  - Visual attention is commonly studied by using visuo-spatial cues
      indicating probable locations of a target and assessing the effect of the
      validity of the cue on perceptual performance and its neural correlates.
      Here, we adapt a cueing task to measure spatial cueing effects on the
      decisions of honeybees and compare their behavior to that of humans and
      monkeys in a similarly structured two-alternative forced-choice perceptual
      task. Unlike the typical cueing paradigm in which the stimulus strength
      remains unchanged within a block of trials, for the monkey and human
      studies we randomized the contrast of the signal to simulate more real
      world conditions in which the organism is uncertain about the strength of
      the signal. A Bayesian ideal observer that weights sensory evidence from
      cued and uncued locations based on the cue validity to maximize overall
      performance is used as a benchmark of comparison against the three animals
      and other suboptimal models: probability matching, ignore the cue, always
      follow the cue, and an additive bias/single decision threshold model. We
      find that the cueing effect is pervasive across all three species but is
      smaller in size than that shown by the Bayesian ideal observer. Humans
      show a larger cueing effect than monkeys and bees show the smallest
      effect. The cueing effect and overall performance of the honeybees allows
      rejection of the models in which the bees are ignoring the cue, following
      the cue and disregarding stimuli to be discriminated, or adopting a
      probability matching strategy. Stimulus strength uncertainty also reduces
      the theoretically predicted variation in cueing effect with stimulus
      strength of an optimal Bayesian observer and diminishes the size of the
      cueing effect when stimulus strength is low. A more biologically plausible
      model that includes an additive bias to the sensory response from the cued
      location, although not mathematically equivalent to the optimal observer
      for the case stimulus strength uncertainty, can approximate the benefits
      of the more computationally complex optimal Bayesian model. We discuss the
      implications of our findings on the field's common conceptualization of
      covert visual attention in the cueing task and what aspects, if any, might
      be unique to humans.

AB  - What we pay attention to is influenced by current task goals
      (goal-directed attention) [1, 2], the physical salience of stimuli
      (stimulus-driven attention) [3-5], and selection history [6-12]. This
      third construct, which encompasses reward learning, aversive conditioning,
      and repetitive orienting behavior [12-18], is often characterized as a
      unitary mechanism of control that can be contrasted with the other two
      [12-14]. Here, we present evidence that two different learning processes
      underlie the influence of selection history on attention, with dissociable
      consequences for orienting behavior. Human observers performed an
      antisaccade task in which they were paid for shifting their gaze in the
      direction opposite one of two color-defined targets. Strikingly, such
      training resulted in a bias to do the opposite of what observers were
      motivated and paid to do, with associative learning facilitating orienting
      toward reward cues. On the other hand, repetitive orienting away from a
      target produced a bias to repeat this behavior even when it conflicted
      with current goals, reflecting instrumental conditioning of the orienting
      response. Our findings challenge the idea that selection history reflects
      a common mechanism of learning-dependent priority and instead suggest
      multiple distinct routes by which learning history shapes orienting
      behavior. We also provide direct evidence for the idea that value-based
      attention is approach oriented, which limits the effectiveness of
      attentional bias modification techniques that utilize incentive
      structures.

AB  - Is attention a purely perceptual process or is it in any way related to
      motor control? The aim of this article is to show that attention puts
      similar demands on a cognitive system as motor control and present
      evidence supporting the view that similar mechanisms operate in the two
      processes. A computational model of attention is presented that uses
      habituation as well as classical and instrumental conditioning to explain
      a number of attentional processes. Evidence from neurophysiology is
      reviewed that suggest that attention is controlled in a way similar to
      actions. This view makes it possible to adapt traditional learning
      theoretical mechanisms to the control of attention. Computer simulations
      are presented that illustrate the operation of the model. (PsycINFO

AB  - Patterns of neural firing linked to eye movement decisions show that
      behavioral decisions are predicted by the differential firing rates of
      cells coding selected and nonselected stimulus alternatives. These results
      can be interpreted using models developed in mathematical psychology to
      model behavioral decisions. Current models assume that decisions are made
      by accumulating noisy stimulus information until sufficient information
      for a response is obtained. Here, the models, and the techniques used to
      test them against response-time distribution and accuracy data, are
      described. Such models provide a quantitative link between the time-course
      of behavioral decisions and the growth of stimulus information in neural
      firing data.

AB  - The deployment of spatial attention induces retinotopically specific
      increases in neural activity that occur even before a target stimulus is
      presented. Although this preparatory activity is thought to prime the
      attended regions, thereby improving perception and recognition, it is not
      yet clear whether this activity is a manifestation of signal enhancement
      at the attended locations or suppression of interference from distracting
      stimuli (or both). We investigated the functional role of these
      preparatory shifts by isolating a distractor suppression component of
      selection. Behavioral data have shown that manipulating the probability
      that visual distractors will appear modulates distractor suppression
      without concurrent changes in signal enhancement. In 2 experiments,
      functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed increased cue-evoked
      activity in retinotopically specific regions of visual cortex when
      increased distractor suppression was elicited by a high probability of
      distractors. This finding directly links cue-evoked preparatory activity
      in visual cortex with a distractor suppression component of visual
      selective attention.

AB  - Both physiological and behavioral studies have suggested that
      stimulus-driven neural activity in the sensory pathways can be modulated
      in amplitude during selective attention. Recordings of event-related brain
      potentials indicate that such sensory gain control or amplification
      processes play an important role in visual-spatial attention. Combined
      event-related brain potential and neuroimaging experiments provide strong
      evidence that attentional gain control operates at an early stage of
      visual processing in extrastriate cortical areas. These data support early
      selection theories of attention and provide a basis for distinguishing
      between separate mechanisms of attentional suppression (of unattended
      inputs) and attentional facilitation (of attended inputs).

AB  - This study is the first to report the benefits of spatial covert attention
      on contrast sensitivity in a wide range of spatial frequencies when a
      target alone was presented in the absence of a local post-mask. We used a
      peripheral precue (a small circle indicating the target location) to
      explore the effects of covert spatial attention on contrast sensitivity as
      assessed by orientation discrimination (Experiments 1-4), detection
      (Experiments 2 and 3) and localization (Experiment 3) tasks. In all four
      experiments the target (a Gabor patch ranging in spatial frequency from
      0.5 to 10 cpd) was presented alone in one of eight possible locations
      equidistant from fixation. Contrast sensitivity was consistently higher
      for peripherally- than for neutrally-cued trials, even though we
      eliminated variables (distracters, global masks, local masks, and location
      uncertainty) that are known to contribute to an external noise reduction
      explanation of attention. When observers were presented with vertical and
      horizontal Gabor patches an external noise reduction signal detection
      model accounted for the cueing benefit in a discrimination task
      (Experiment 1). However, such a model could not account for this benefit
      when location uncertainty was reduced, either by: (a) Increasing overall
      performance level (Experiment 2); (b) increasing stimulus contrast to
      enable fine discriminations of slightly tilted suprathreshold stimuli
      (Experiment 3); and (c) presenting a local post-mask (Experiment 4). Given
      that attentional benefits occurred under conditions that exclude all
      variables predicted by the external noise reduction model, these results
      support the signal enhancement model of attention.

AB  - Computational models of classical conditioning have made significant
      contributions to the theoretic understanding of associative learning, yet
      they still struggle when the temporal aspects of conditioning are taken
      into account. Interval timing models have contributed a rich variety of
      time representations and provided accurate predictions for the timing of
      responses, but they usually have little to say about associative learning.
      In this article we present a unified model of conditioning and timing that
      is based on the influential Rescorla-Wagner conditioning model and the
      more recently developed Timing Drift-Diffusion model. We test the model by
      simulating 10 experimental phenomena and show that it can provide an
      adequate account for 8, and a partial account for the other 2. We argue
      that the model can account for more phenomena in the chosen set than these
      other similar in scope models: CSC-TD, MS-TD, Learning to Time and Modular
      Theory. A comparison and analysis of the mechanisms in these models is
      provided, with a focus on the types of time representation and associative
      learning rule used.

AB  - Previous studies have provided evidence that selective attention tends to
      prioritize the processing of stimuli that are good predictors of upcoming
      events over nonpredictive stimuli. Moreover, studies using eye-tracking to
      measure attention demonstrate that this attentional bias towards
      predictive stimuli is at least partially under voluntary control and can
      be flexibly adapted via instruction. Our experiment took a similar
      approach to these prior studies, manipulating participants' experience of
      the predictiveness of different stimuli over the course of trial-by-trial
      training; we then provided explicit verbal instructions regarding stimulus
      predictiveness that were designed to be either consistent or inconsistent
      with the previously established learned predictiveness. Critically, we
      measured the effects of training and instruction on attention to stimuli
      using a dot probe task, which allowed us to assess rapid shifts of
      attention (unlike the eye-gaze measures used in previous studies). Results
      revealed a rapid attentional bias towards stimuli experienced as
      predictive (versus those experienced as nonpredictive), that was
      completely unaffected by verbal instructions. This was not due to
      participants' failure to recall or use instructions appropriately, as
      revealed by analyses of their learning about stimuli, and their memory for
      instructions. Overall, these findings suggest that rapid attentional
      biases such as those measured by the dot probe task are more strongly
      influenced by our prior experience during training than by our current
      explicit knowledge acquired via instruction.

AB  - Predictive coding postulates that we make (top-down) predictions about the
      world and that we continuously compare incoming (bottom-up) sensory
      information with these predictions, in order to update our models and
      perception so as to better reflect reality. That is, our so-called
      "Bayesian brains" continuously create and update generative models of the
      world, inferring (hidden) causes from (sensory) consequences. Neuroimaging
      datasets enable the detailed investigation of such modeling and updating
      processes, and these datasets can themselves be analyzed with Bayesian
      approaches. These offer methodological advantages over classical
      statistics. Specifically, any number of models can be compared, the models
      need not be nested, and the "null model" can be accepted (rather than only
      failing to be rejected as in frequentist inference). This methodological
      paper explains how to construct posterior probability maps (PPMs) for
      Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) at the group level using
      electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. The
      method has only recently been used for EEG data, after originally being
      developed and applied in the context of functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) analysis. Here, we describe how this method can be adapted
      for EEG using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) software package
      for MATLAB. The method enables the comparison of an arbitrary number of
      hypotheses (or explanations for observed responses), at each and every
      voxel in the brain (source level) and/or in the scalp-time volume (scalp
      level), both within participants and at the group level. The method is
      illustrated here using mismatch negativity (MMN) data from a group of
      participants performing an audio-spatial oddball attention task. All data
      and code are provided in keeping with the Open Science movement. In doing
      so, we hope to enable others in the field of M/EEG to implement our
      methods so as to address their own questions of interest.

AB  - In theoretical accounts of perceptual decision-making, a decision variable
      integrates noisy sensory evidence and determines action through a
      boundary-crossing criterion. Signals bearing these very properties have
      been characterized in single neurons in monkeys, but have yet to be
      directly identified in humans. Using a gradual target detection task, we
      isolated a freely evolving decision variable signal in human subjects that
      exhibited every aspect of the dynamics observed in its single-neuron
      counterparts. This signal could be continuously tracked in parallel with
      fully dissociable sensory encoding and motor preparation signals, and
      could be systematically perturbed mid-flight during decision formation.
      Furthermore, we found that the signal was completely domain general: it
      exhibited the same decision-predictive dynamics regardless of sensory
      modality and stimulus features and tracked cumulative evidence even in the
      absence of overt action. These findings provide a uniquely clear view on
      the neural determinants of simple perceptual decisions in humans.

      serve as an explanatory framework and guide ongoing experimental inquiry.
      This intertwining of theory and experiment now suggests very clearly that
      the phasic activity of the midbrain dopamine neurons provides a global
      mechanism for synaptic modification. These synaptic modifications, in
      turn, provide the mechanistic underpinning for a specific class of
      reinforcement learning mechanisms that now seem to underlie much of human
      and animal behavior. This review describes both the critical empirical
      findings that are at the root of this conclusion and the fantastic
      theoretical advances from which this conclusion is drawn.

AB  - The striatum is essential for learning which actions lead to reward and
      for implementing those actions. Decades of experimental and theoretical
      work have led to several influential theories and hypotheses about how the
      striatal circuit mediates these functions. However, owing to technical
      limitations, testing these hypotheses rigorously has been difficult. In
      this Review, we briefly describe some of the classic ideas of striatal
      function. We then review recent studies in rodents that take advantage of
      optical and genetic methods to test these classic ideas by recording and
      manipulating identified cell types within the circuit. This new body of
      work has provided experimental support of some longstanding ideas about
      the striatal circuit and has uncovered critical aspects of the classic
      view that are incorrect or incomplete.

AB  - Recent behavioral studies in both humans and rodents have found evidence
      that performance in decision-making tasks depends on two different
      learning processes; one encoding the relationship between actions and
      their consequences and a second involving the formation of
      stimulus-response associations. These learning processes are thought to
      govern goal-directed and habitual actions, respectively, and have been
      found to depend on homologous corticostriatal networks in these species.
      Thus, recent research using comparable behavioral tasks in both humans and
      rats has implicated homologous regions of cortex (medial prefrontal
      cortex/medial orbital cortex in humans and prelimbic cortex in rats) and
      of dorsal striatum (anterior caudate in humans and dorsomedial striatum in
      rats) in goal-directed action and in the control of habitual actions
      (posterior lateral putamen in humans and dorsolateral striatum in rats).
      These learning processes have been argued to be antagonistic or competing
      because their control over performance appears to be all or none.
      Nevertheless, evidence has started to accumulate suggesting that they may
      at times compete and at others cooperate in the selection and subsequent
      evaluation of actions necessary for normal choice performance. It appears
      likely that cooperation or competition between these sources of action
      control depends not only on local interactions in dorsal striatum but also
      on the cortico-basal ganglia network within which the striatum is embedded
      and that mediates the integration of learning with basic motivational and
      emotional processes. The neural basis of the integration of learning and
      motivation in choice and decision-making is still controversial and we
      review some recent hypotheses relating to this issue.

AB  - Spatial attention is a lateralized feature of the human brain. Whereas the
      role of cortical areas of the nondominant hemisphere on spatial attention
      has been investigated in detail, the impact of the BG, and more precisely
      the subthalamic nucleus, on signs and symptoms of spatial attention is not
      well understood. Here we used unilateral deep brain stimulation of the
      subthalamic nucleus to reversibly, specifically, and intraindividually
      modify the neuronal BG outflow and its consequences on signs and symptoms
      of visuospatial attention in patients suffering from Parkinson disease. We
      tested 13 patients with Parkinson disease and chronic deep brain
      stimulation in three stimulation settings: unilateral right and left deep
      brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus as well as bilateral deep
      brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus. In all three stimulation
      settings, the patients viewed a set of pictures while an eye-tracker
      system recorded eye movements. During the exploration of the visual
      stimuli, we analyzed the time spent in each visual hemispace, as well as
      the number, duration, amplitude, peak velocity, acceleration peak, and
      speed of saccades. In the unilateral left-sided stimulation setting,
      patients show a shorter ipsilateral exploration time of the extrapersonal
      space, whereas number, duration, and speed of saccades did not differ
      between the different stimulation settings. These results demonstrated
      reduced visuospatial attention toward the side contralateral to the right
      subthalamic nucleus that was not being stimulated in a unilateral
      left-sided stimulation. Turning on the right stimulator, the reduced
      visuospatial attention vanished. These results support the involvement of
      the subthalamic nucleus in modulating spatial attention. Therefore, the
      subthalamic nucleus is part of the subcortical network that subserves
      spatial attention.

AB  - ABSTRACT When a behaviorally relevant stimulus has been previously
      associated with reward, behavioral responses are faster and more accurate
      compared to equally relevant but less valuable stimuli. Conversely, task
      irrelevant stimuli that were previously associated with a high reward can
      capture attention and distract processing away from relevant stimuli (e.g.
      the chocolate bar in the pantry when you are looking for a nice healthy
      apple). While increasing the value of task-relevant stimuli systematically
      up-regulates neural responses in early visual cortex to facilitate
      information processing, it is not clear if the value of task-irrelevant
      distractors influences behavior via competition in early visual cortex or
      via competition at later stages of decision-making and response selection.
      Here, we measured fMRI in human visual cortex while subjects performed a
      value-based learning task, and applied a multivariate inverted encoding
      model to assess the fidelity of distractor representations in early visual
      cortex. We found that the fidelity of neural representations related to
      task-irrelevant distractors increased when the distractors were previously
      associated with a high reward. Moreover, this value-based modulation of
      distractor representations only occurred when the distractors were
      previously selected as targets on preceding trials. Together, these
      findings suggest that value-driven attentional capture begins with sensory
      modulations of distractor representations in early areas of visual cortex.

AB  - To find a target object in a crowded scene, a face in a crowd for example,
      the visual system might turn the neural representation of each object on
      and off in a serial fashion, testing each representation against a
      template of the target item. Alternatively, it might allow the processing
      of all objects in parallel but bias activity in favor of those neurons
      that represent critical features of the target, until the target emerges
      from the background. To test these possibilities, we recorded neurons in
      area V4 of monkeys freely scanning a complex array to find a target
      defined by color, shape, or both. Throughout the period of searching,
      neurons gave enhanced responses and synchronized their activity in the
      gamma range whenever a preferred stimulus in their receptive field matched
      a feature of the target, as predicted by parallel models. Neurons also
      gave enhanced responses to candidate targets that were selected for
      saccades, or foveation, reflecting a serial component of visual search.
      Thus, serial and parallel mechanisms of response enhancement and neural
      synchrony work together to identify objects in a scene. To find a target

AB  - A novel lateralised reaction time task is described and used to evaluate
      the effects of D-amphetamine injections and unilateral dorso-striatal
      lesions in rats. The task involves a two-lever Skinner box adaptation of
      the nine-hole box visual choice reaction time task first developed by
      Carli et al. D-Amphetamine had a dose dependent effect on nearly all
      aspects of task performance. Low and the intermediate doses of
      D-amphetamine speeded reaction time and movement time, and abolished the
      delay-dependent pattern or responding in the task. The highest dose of
      amphetamine disrupted the animals' ability to perform reliably, the task
      contingencies. Unilateral lesions in the dorsal neostriatum resulted in an
      increase of error trials, produced a bias to respond towards the
      ipsilateral side, and decreased the accuracy of responding to
      contralateral stimuli. The overall mean reaction time to contralateral
      stimuli was not influenced by the lesions, but the movement time was
      increased selectively when responding to contralateral stimuli. The data
      suggest that striatal activation by amphetamine increases motor readiness,
      which can enhance reaction time performance at the cost of increased
      errors due to anticipation of cue presentation, in particular at long
      holding delays. Conversely, striatal lesions induce lateralised defects in
      executive, rather than sensory, processes, and impair the animals' ability
      to execute movement towards the contralateral side.

AB  - Objects associated with reward draw attention and evoke enhanced activity
      in visual cortex. What is the underlying mechanism? One possibility is
      that reward's impact on vision is mediated by unique circuitry that
      modulates sensory processing, selectively increasing the salience of
      reward-associated stimuli. Alternatively, effects of reward may be part of
      a more general mechanism that prioritizes the processing of any beneficial
      object, importantly including stimuli that are associated with the evasion
      of loss. Here, we test these competing hypotheses by having male and
      female humans detect naturalistic objects associated with monetary reward,
      the evasion of equivalent loss, or neither of these. If vision is
      economically normative, processing of objects associated with reward and
      evasion of loss should be prioritized relative to neutral stimuli. Results
      from fMRI and behavioral experiments show that this is not the case:
      whereas objects associated with reward were better detected and
      represented in ventral visual cortex, detection and representation of
      stimuli associated with the evasion of loss were degraded. Representations
      in parietal cortex reveal a notable exception to this pattern, showing
      enhanced encoding of both reward- and loss-associated stimuli.
      Experience-driven visual prioritization can thus be economically
      irrational, driven by valence rather than objective utility.SIGNIFICANCE
      STATEMENT Normative economic models propose that gain should have the same
      value as evasion of equivalent loss. Is human vision rational in this way?
      Objects associated with reward draw attention and are well represented in
      visual cortex. This is thought to have evolutionary origins, highlighting
      objects likely to provide benefit in the future. But benefit can be
      conferred not only through gain, but also through evasion of loss. Here we
      demonstrate that the visual system prioritizes real-world objects
      presented in images of natural scenes only when these objects have been
      associated with reward, not when they have provided the opportunity to
      evade financial loss. Visual selection is thus non-normative and
      economically irrational, driven by valence rather than objective utility.

AB  - To draw causal conclusions about the efficacy of a psychological
      intervention, researchers must compare the treatment condition with a
      control group that accounts for improvements caused by factors other than
      the treatment. Using an active control helps to control for the
      possibility that improvement by the experimental group resulted from a
      placebo effect. Although active control groups are superior to
      "no-contact" controls, only when the active control group has the same
      expectation of improvement as the experimental group can we attribute
      differential improvements to the potency of the treatment. Despite the
      need to match expectations between treatment and control groups, almost no
      psychological interventions do so. This failure to control for
      expectations is not a minor omission-it is a fundamental design flaw that
      potentially undermines any causal inference. We illustrate these
      principles with a detailed example from the video-game-training literature
      showing how the use of an active control group does not eliminate
      expectation differences. The problem permeates other interventions as
      well, including those targeting mental health, cognition, and educational
      achievement. Fortunately, measuring expectations and adopting alternative
      experimental designs makes it possible to control for placebo effects,
      thereby increasing confidence in the causal efficacy of psychological
      interventions.

TI  - The dual-task practice advantage: Empirical evidence and cognitive
      mechanisms
T2  - Psychon. Bull. Rev.
PY  - 2019
DA  - 2019/5/31
AB  - Practice of two simultaneous component tasks in dual-task situations leads
      to an improvement in dual-task performance. The present paper reviews
      empirical evidence for this practice-related improvement and discusses its
      underlying cognitive mechanisms. In particular, the robustness of the
      phenomenon of dual-task practice advantage (DTPA) is evaluated. This
      phenomenon is described as an advantage in dual-task performance at the
      end of dual-task practice (i.e., simultaneous task practice) in comparison
      to the dual-task performance after single-task practice (i.e., separate
      task practice). The review investigates the existence of empirical
      evidence of the DTPA phenomenon and specifications of its mechanisms in
      the context of the allocation and scheduling hypothesis and the
      integration hypothesis. Evidence for the existence of the DTPA phenomenon
      and the allocation and scheduling hypothesis was demonstrated in dual
      tasks with (1) combinations of two sensorimotor tasks, (2) combinations of
      one continuous task and one sensorimotor task, (3) combinations of two
      working-memory tasks, and (4) combinations of one motor task and one
      cognitive task. In contrast, the findings demonstrate that the DTPA
      phenomenon in dual tasks with (5) combinations of two long-term memory
      retrieval tasks can instead be explained by the integration hypothesis.
      The relevance of these findings is discussed in relation to real-world
      problems.

AB  - Rhythmic events recruit neuronal activity in the basal ganglia and
      cerebellum, but their roles remain elusive. In monkeys attempting to
      detect a single omission of isochronous visual stimulus, we found that
      neurons in the caudate nucleus showed increased activity for each stimulus
      in sequence, while those in the cerebellar dentate nucleus showed
      decreased activity. Firing modulation in the majority of caudate neurons
      and all cerebellar neurons was proportional to the stimulus interval, but
      a quarter of caudate neurons displayed a clear duration tuning.
      Furthermore, the time course of population activity in the cerebellum well
      predicted stimulus timing, whereas that in the caudate reflected
      stochastic variation of response latency. Electrical stimulation to the
      respective recording sites confirmed a causal role in the detection of
      stimulus omission. These results suggest that striatal neurons might
      represent periodic response preparation while cerebellar nuclear neurons
      may play a role in temporal prediction of periodic events.

AB  - The basal ganglia (BG) form a network of subcortical nuclei. Functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the BG could provide insight in its
      functioning and the underlying mechanisms of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS).
      However, fMRI of the BG with high specificity is challenging, because the
      nuclei are small and variable in their anatomical location. High
      resolution fMRI at field strengths of 7 Tesla (T) could help resolve these
      challenges to some extent. A set of MR protocols was developed for
      functional imaging of the BG nuclei at 3 T and 7 T. The protocols were
      validated using a stop-signal reaction task (Logan et al. []: J Exp
      Psychol: Human Percept Perform 10:276-291). Compared with sub-millimeter 7
      T fMRI protocols aimed at cortex, a reduction of echo time and spatial
      resolution was strictly necessary to obtain robust Blood Oxygen Level
      Dependent (BOLD) sensitivity in the BG. An fMRI protocol at 3 T with
      identical resolution to the 7 T showed no robust BOLD sensitivity in any
      of the BG nuclei. The results suggest that the subthalamic nucleus, as
      well as the substantia nigra, red nucleus, and the internal and external
      parts of the globus pallidus show increased activation in failed stop
      trials compared with successful stop and go trials. Hum Brain Mapp

AB  - One of the most salient and well-recognized features of human
      goal-directed behavior is our limited ability to conduct multiple
      demanding tasks at once. Previous work has identified overlap between task
      processing pathways as a limiting factor for multitasking performance in
      neural architectures. This raises an important question: insofar as shared
      representation between tasks introduces the risk of cross-talk and thereby
      limitations in multitasking, why would the brain prefer shared task
      representations over separate representations across …

AB  - In neuroimaging research on attention, cognitive control, decision-making,
      and other areas where response time (RT) is a critical variable, the
      temporal variability associated with the decision is often assumed to be
      inconsequential to the hemodynamic response (HDR) in rapid event-related
      designs. On this basis, the majority of published studies model brain
      activity lasting less than 4 s with brief impulses representing the onset
      of neural or cognitive events, which are then convolved with the
      hemodynamic impulse response function (HRF). However, electrophysiological
      studies have shown that decision-related neuronal activity is not
      instantaneous, but in fact, often lasts until the motor response. It is
      therefore possible that small differences in neural processing durations,
      similar to human RTs, will produce noticeable changes in the HDR, and
      therefore in the results of regression analyses. In this study we compare
      the effectiveness of traditional models that assume no temporal variance
      with a model that explicitly accounts for the duration of very brief
      epochs of neural activity. Using both simulations and fMRI data, we show
      that brief differences in duration are detectable, making it possible to
      dissociate the effects of stimulus intensity from stimulus duration, and
      that optimizing the model for the type of activity being detected improves
      the statistical power, consistency, and interpretability of results.

TI  - The Generalizability Crisis
PY  - 2019
DA  - 2019/11
AB  - Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their
      evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures.
      The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends
      on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely
      aligned—that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of
      hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical
      tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. I demonstrate how
      foundational assumptions of the "random effects" model used pervasively in
      psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of
      results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints
      dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers
      to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful
      connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I
      argue that the routine failure to consider the generalizability of one's
      conclusions from a statistical perspective lies at the root of many of
      psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude
      with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.

AB  - Arguably, the most difficult part of learning is deciding what to learn
      about. Should I associate the positive outcome of safely completing a
      street-crossing with the situation 'the car approaching the crosswalk was
      red' or with 'the approaching car was slowing down'? In this Perspective,
      we summarize our recent research into the computational and neural
      underpinnings of 'representation learning'-how humans (and other animals)
      construct task representations that allow efficient learning and
      decision-making. We first discuss the problem of learning what to ignore
      when confronted with too much information, so that experience can properly
      generalize across situations. We then turn to the problem of augmenting
      perceptual information with inferred latent causes that embody
      unobservable task-relevant information, such as contextual knowledge.
      Finally, we discuss recent findings regarding the neural substrates of
      task representations that suggest the orbitofrontal cortex represents
      'task states', deploying them for decision-making and learning elsewhere
      in the brain.

AB  - Parallel developments in neuroscience and deep learning have led to
      mutually productive exchanges, pushing our understanding of real and
      artificial neural networks in sensory and cognitive systems. However, this
      interaction between fields is less developed in the study of motor
      control. In this work, we develop a virtual rodent as a platform for the
      grounded study of motor activity in artificial models of embodied control.
      We then use this platform to study motor activity across contexts by
      training a model to solve four complex tasks. Using methods familiar to
      neuroscientists, we describe the behavioral representations and algorithms
      employed by different layers of the network using a neuroethological
      approach to characterize motor activity relative to the rodent's behavior
      and goals. We find that the model uses two classes of representations
      which respectively encode the task-specific behavioral strategies and
      task-invariant behavioral kinematics. These representations are reflected
      in the sequential activity and population dynamics of neural
      subpopulations. Overall, the virtual rodent facilitates grounded
      collaborations between deep reinforcement learning and motor neuroscience.

AB  - The occurrence of collinearity in fMRI-based GLMs (general linear models)
      may reduce power or produce unreliable parameter estimates. It is commonly
      believed that orthogonalizing collinear regressors in the model will solve
      this problem, and some software packages apply automatic
      orthogonalization. However, the effects of orthogonalization on the
      interpretation of the resulting parameter estimates is widely
      unappreciated or misunderstood. Here we discuss the nature and causes of
      collinearity in fMRI models, with a focus on the appropriate uses of
      orthogonalization. Special attention is given to how the two popular fMRI
      data analysis software packages, SPM and FSL, handle orthogonalization,
      and pitfalls that may be encountered in their usage. Strategies are
      discussed for reducing collinearity in fMRI designs and addressing their
      effects when they occur.

AB  - A striking limitation of human cognition is our inability to execute some
      tasks simultaneously. Recent work suggests that such limitations can arise

      the sharing of representations between tasks: sharing promotes quicker
      learning, at the expense of interference while multitasking. From this
      perspective, multitasking failures might reflect a preference for learning

AB  - A minimal hypothesis is proposed concerning the brain processes underlying
      effortful tasks. It distinguishes two main computational spaces: a unique
      global workspace composed of distributed and heavily interconnected
      neurons with long-range axons, and a set of specialized and modular
      perceptual, motor, memory, evaluative, and attentional processors.
      Workspace neurons are mobilized in effortful tasks for which the
      specialized processors do not suffice. They selectively mobilize or
      suppress, through descending connections, the contribution of specific
      processor neurons. In the course of task performance, workspace neurons
      become spontaneously coactivated, forming discrete though variable
      spatio-temporal patterns subject to modulation by vigilance signals and to
      selection by reward signals. A computer simulation of the Stroop task
      shows workspace activation to increase during acquisition of a novel task,
      effortful execution, and after errors. We outline predictions for
      spatio-temporal activation patterns during brain imaging, particularly
      about the contribution of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior
      cingulate to the workspace.

TI  - Introspection about backward crosstalk in dual-task performance

AB  - The present study investigated participants' ability to introspect about
      the effect of between-task crosstalk in dual tasks. In two experiments,
      participants performed a compatibility-based backward crosstalk dual task,
      and additionally provided estimates of their RTs (introspective reaction
      times, IRTs) after each trial (Experiment 1) or after each pair of prime
      and test trials (Experiment 2). In both experiments, the objective
      performance showed the typical backward crosstalk effect and its
      sequential modulation depending on compatibility in the previous trial.
      Very similar patterns were observed in IRTs, despite the typical
      unawareness of the PRP effect. In sum, these results demonstrate the
      reliability of between-task crosstalk in dual tasks and that people's
      introspection about the temporal processing demands in this complex
      dual-task situation is intriguingly accurate and severely limited at the
      same time.

      limitations in the simultaneous execution of control-demanding behaviors

AB  - Why is it that behaviors that rely on control, so striking in their
      diversity and flexibility, are also subject to such striking limitations?
      Typically, people cannot engage in more than a few-and usually only a
      single-control-demanding task at a time. This limitation was a defining
      element in the earliest conceptualizations of controlled processing; it
      remains one of the most widely accepted axioms of cognitive psychology,
      and is even the basis for some laws (e.g., against the use of mobile
      devices while driving). Remarkably, however, the source of this limitation
      is still not understood. Here, we examine one potential source of this
      limitation, in terms of a trade-off between the flexibility and efficiency
      of representation ("multiplexing") and the simultaneous engagement of
      different processing pathways ("multitasking"). We show that even a modest
      amount of multiplexing rapidly introduces cross-talk among processing
      pathways, thereby constraining the number that can be productively engaged
      at once. We propose that, given the large number of advantages of
      efficient coding, the human brain has favored this over the capacity for
      multitasking of control-demanding processes.

AB  - Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to
      analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying
      assumptions. Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI,
      BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and
      analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However,
      this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several
      issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging
      analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis
      software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm
      development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories
      often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes
      time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational
      efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate
      for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype
      (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces;
      http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software
      package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing
      Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics
      and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows.
      Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of
      algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages,
      allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the
      learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both
      local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without
      additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed,
      allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven development
      philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and address the varied
      needs of the evolving neuroimaging community, especially in the context of
      increasing demand for reproducible research.

AB  - Preprocessing of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) involves
      numerous steps to clean and standardize the data before statistical
      analysis. Generally, researchers create ad hoc preprocessing workflows for
      each dataset, building upon a large inventory of available tools. The
      complexity of these workflows has snowballed with rapid advances in
      acquisition and processing. We introduce fMRIPrep, an analysis-agnostic
      tool that addresses the challenge of robust and reproducible preprocessing
      for fMRI data. fMRIPrep automatically adapts a best-in-breed workflow to
      the idiosyncrasies of virtually any dataset, ensuring high-quality
      preprocessing without manual intervention. By introducing visual
      assessment checkpoints into an iterative integration framework for
      software testing, we show that fMRIPrep robustly produces high-quality
      results on a diverse fMRI data collection. Additionally, fMRIPrep
      introduces less uncontrolled spatial smoothness than observed with
      commonly used preprocessing tools. fMRIPrep equips neuroscientists with an
      easy-to-use and transparent preprocessing workflow, which can help ensure
      the validity of inference and the interpretability of results.
