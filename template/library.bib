              networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              requires a data acquisition protocol that provides
              blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) sensitivity across the
              entire brain. However, when using standard single echo, echo
              planar imaging protocols, researchers face a tradeoff between
              BOLD-sensitivity in cortex and in subcortical areas. Multi echo
              protocols avoid this tradeoff and can be used to optimize
              BOLD-sensitivity across the entire brain, at the cost of an
              increased repetition time. Here, we empirically compare the
              BOLD-sensitivity of a single echo protocol to a multi echo
              protocol. Both protocols were designed to meet the specific
              requirements for studying small, iron rich subcortical structures
              (including a relatively high spatial resolution and short echo
              times), while retaining coverage and BOLD-sensitivity in cortical
              areas. The results indicate that both sequences lead to similar
              BOLD-sensitivity across the brain at 7 ​T.",

              Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown that the
              subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra are selectively involved
              in response inhibition, conflict processing, and adjusting global
              and selective response thresholds. However, imaging these nuclei
              is complex, because they are in such close proximity, they can
              vary in location, and are very small relative to the resolution
              of most fMRI sequences. Here, we investigated the consistency in
              localization of these nuclei in BOLD fMRI studies, comparing
              reported coordinates with probabilistic atlas maps of young human
              participants derived from ultra-high resolution 7T MRI scanning.
              We show that the fMRI signal reported in previous studies is
              likely not unequivocally arising from the subthalamic nucleus but
              represents a mixture of subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra,
              and surrounding tissue. Using a simulation study, we also tested
              to what extent spatial smoothing, often used in fMRI
              preprocessing pipelines, influences the mixture of BOLD signals.
              We propose concrete steps how to analyze fMRI BOLD data to allow
              inferences about the functional role of small subcortical nuclei
              like the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra.",

              argue that the material conditions in which people grow up and
              live have a lasting impact on their personal and social
              identities and that this influences both the way they think and
              feel about their social environment and key aspects of their
              social behaviour. Relative to middle-class counterparts,
              lower/working-class individuals are less likely to define
              themselves in terms of their socioeconomic status and are more
              likely to have interdependent self-concepts; they are also more
              inclined to explain social events in situational terms, as a
              result of having a lower sense of personal control. Working-class
              people score higher on measures of empathy and are more likely to
              help others in distress. The widely held view that working-class
              individuals are more prejudiced towards immigrants and ethnic
              minorities is shown to be a function of economic threat, in that
              highly educated people also express prejudice towards these
              groups when the latter are described as highly educated and
              therefore pose an economic threat. The fact that middle-class
              norms of independence prevail in universities and prestigious
              workplaces makes working-class people less likely to apply for
              positions in such institutions, less likely to be selected and
              less likely to stay if selected. In other words, social class
              differences in identity, cognition, feelings, and behaviour make
              it less likely that working-class individuals can benefit from
              educational and occupational opportunities to improve their
              material circumstances. This means that redistributive policies
              are needed to break the cycle of deprivation that limits

  abstract = "Operational risk has been among the three most significant types
              of risks in the financial services industry, and its management
              is mandated by Basel II regulations. To inform better labor
              decisions, this paper studies how workload affects banks'
              operational risk event occurrence. To achieve this goal, we use a
              unique data set from a commercial bank in China that contains
              1,441 operational risk events over 16 months. We find that
              workload has a U-shaped impact on operational risk error rate.
              More specifically, the error rate of operational risk events
              decreases first, as workload increases, and then increases.
              Furthermore, when workload is low, employees tend to make
              performance-seeking risks; however, when workload is high,
              employees tend to exhibit quality degradation due to cognitive
              multitasking. Based on the causal relationship between workload
              and operational risk events from the empirical analysis, we
              discuss staffing policies among branches aimed at reducing
              operational risk losses. We find that employing a flexible
              staffing rule can significantly reduce the number of operational
              risk events by more than 3\% under different scenarios. In
              addition, this significant performance improvement can be
              achieved byadding even a little bit of flexibility to the process
              by allowing employees to either switch their business lines in

              in experimental studies to reduce individuals' task performance.
              These behaviours are frequently used by clinicians in
              high-workload, dynamic clinical environments, yet their effects
              have rarely been studied. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative
              contributions of interruptions and multitasking by emergency
              physicians to prescribing errors. METHODS: 36 emergency
              physicians were shadowed over 120 hours. All tasks, interruptions
              and instances of multitasking were recorded. Physicians' working
              memory capacity (WMC) and preference for multitasking were
              assessed using the Operation Span Task (OSPAN) and Inventory of
              Polychronic Values. Following observation, physicians were asked
              about their sleep in the previous 24 hours. Prescribing errors
              were used as a measure of task performance. We performed
              multivariate analysis of prescribing error rates to determine
              associations with interruptions and multitasking, also
              considering physician seniority, age, psychometric measures,
              workload and sleep. RESULTS: Physicians experienced 7.9
              interruptions/hour. 28 clinicians were observed prescribing 239
              medication orders which contained 208 prescribing errors. While
              prescribing, clinicians were interrupted 9.4 times/hour. Error
              rates increased significantly if physicians were interrupted
              (rate ratio (RR) 2.82; 95\% CI 1.23 to 6.49) or multitasked (RR
              1.86; 95\% CI 1.35 to 2.56) while prescribing. Having
              below-average sleep showed a >15-fold increase in clinical error
              rate (RR 16.44; 95\% CI 4.84 to 55.81). WMC was protective
              against errors; for every 10-point increase on the 75-point
              OSPAN, a 19\% decrease in prescribing errors was observed. There
              was no effect of polychronicity, workload, physician gender or
              above-average sleep on error rates. CONCLUSION: Interruptions,
              multitasking and poor sleep were associated with significantly
              increased rates of prescribing errors among emergency physicians.
              WMC mitigated the negative influence of these factors to an
              extent. These results confirm experimental findings in other
              fields and raise questions about the acceptability of the high
              rates of multitasking and interruption in clinical environments.",

               evidence was found for separable attentional systems consisting

               between exogenous and endogenous control of visual attention.
               Subjects searched for a target letter among three nontarget
               letters that were positioned on an imaginary circle around a
               fixation point. At different cue-display intervals, a centrally
               located arrowhead cue reliably indicated the location of the
               target letter. At different SOAs, a peripheral line segment near
               one of the letters was either abruptly switched on (Experiment
               1) or abruptly switched off (Experiment 2). Presenting the
               central arrowhead after display onset prevents attention from
               being focused in advance on the critical location. In this
               unfocused attentional state, both onset and offset transients
               attracted attention. When the central arrowhead was available in
               advance, the focusing of attention prior to display onset
               precluded attention attraction to the location of the onset or
               offset transient. Contrary to an offset transient, an onset
               transient presented at the attended location disrupted
               performance, indicating that an onset within the spotlight of
               attention attracts attention. The results are reconciled by
               means of the zoom-lens theory of attention, suggesting that
               outside the focus of attention, abrupt transients are not
               capable of attracting attention. Since the size of the zoom lens
               is under voluntary control, it can be argued that transients do

  abstract  = "Three experiments are reported which investigate the possibility
               of habituation of externally-controlled covert orienting with
               repetition. A brief event in the visual field (for example, a
               luminance change) can speed the detection response to a target
               if it occurs in the same location within approx. 100 msec and
               can bias temporal order judgments in the absence of eye
               movements. This early facilitatory component is seen as the
               result of an externally-controlled covert orienting response,
               that is, the realignment of attention, but not the eyes, with
               the location of the initial event. However, after approx. 300
               msec, the response to a target appearing in the same location is
               slower than to one appearing elsewhere (the inhibitory
               component). Experiment 1 employed a cue-target procedure, the
               subject's task being to ignore each non-informative cue but to
               respond as quickly as possible to the onset of each target.
               Three conditions were investigated which differed according to
               the number of consecutive cues presented in the same location
               [1, 5, 30]. Facilitatory and inhibitory components were present
               in all three, indicating that under these conditions,
               externally-controlled covert orienting does not habituate with
               repetition and occurs to non-random as well as random sequences
               of cues. In addition, there was evidence that the inhibitory
               component is larger for a response to a target appearing in the
               same location as the cue and the previous target than in the
               same location as the cue only. In order to investigate this
               further, a continuous target-target procedure was used in
               experiments 2 and 3 (simple and choice reaction time, with 3 and
               1 response-stimulus intervals respectively), which demonstrated
               that inhibition does not build up over successive repetitions of
               targets appearing in the same location, but actually decreases.
               The results are discussed in relation to the possible functions
               of the facilitatory and inhibitory components in maintaining

              allow us to interact with our complex environment in a
              goal-directed manner. Humans regularly challenge these control
              processes when attempting to simultaneously accomplish multiple
              goals (multitasking), generating interference as the result of
              fundamental information processing limitations. It is clear that
              multitasking behaviour has become ubiquitous in today's
              technologically dense world, and substantial evidence has accrued
              regarding multitasking difficulties and cognitive control
              deficits in our ageing population. Here we show that multitasking
              performance, as assessed with a custom-designed three-dimensional
              video game (NeuroRacer), exhibits a linear age-related decline
              from 20 to 79 years of age. By playing an adaptive version of
              NeuroRacer in multitasking training mode, older adults (60 to 85
              years old) reduced multitasking costs compared to both an active
              control group and a no-contact control group, attaining levels
              beyond those achieved by untrained 20-year-old participants, with
              gains persisting for 6 months. Furthermore, age-related deficits
              in neural signatures of cognitive control, as measured with
              electroencephalography, were remediated by multitasking training
              (enhanced midline frontal theta power and frontal-posterior theta
              coherence). Critically, this training resulted in performance
              benefits that extended to untrained cognitive control abilities

              distributed representation in these TD algorithms: distributed
              representations of belief and distributed discounting factors.
              Distributed representation of belief allows the believed state of
              the world to distribute across sets of equivalent states.
              Distributed exponential discounting factors produce hyperbolic
              discounting in the behavior of the agent itself. We examine these
              issues in the context of a TD RL model in which state-belief is
              distributed over a set of exponentially-discounting
              ``micro-Agents'', each of which has a separate discounting factor
              (gamma). Each microAgent maintains an independent hypothesis
              about the state of the world, and a separate value-estimate of
              taking actions within that hypothesized state. The overall agent
              thus instantiates a flexible representation of an evolving
              world-state. As with other TD models, the value-error (delta)
              signal within the model matches dopamine signals recorded from
              animals in standard conditioning reward-paradigms. The

              attributes it to a bottleneck process that not only selects the
              appropriate response but also monitors its execution. In two

              Task 2. In each experiment, a propagation effect of movement
              distance on reaction time in Task 2 indicated substantial
              execution-related interference. To determine the locus of this
              effect, we manipulated stimulus-response compatibility in Task 2.

              effect was partially absorbed during movement execution of Task
              1. The results support a motor bottleneck mechanism rather than

              physiological and pathological conditions. The left hemisphere
              (LH) dominance for language, observed in approximately 90\% of
              healthy individuals and in 70\% of patients, is grounded by
              intra-hemispheric connections mediated by associative bundles
              such as the arcuate fasciculus and inter-hemispheric
              transcallosal connections mediated by the corpus callosum that
              connects homotopic regions of the left and right hemispheres
              (RH). In typical brains, inter-hemispheric inhibition, exerted
              from the LH to the RH, permits the LH to maintain language
              dominance. In pathological conditions, inter- and
              intra-hemispheric inhibition is decreased, inducing modifications

              differences in studies of the rodent hippocampus. Asymmetries
              identified so far suggest that a bilateral model of the
              hippocampus will be essential for an understanding of this brain
              region, and perhaps of the brain more widely. Although hypotheses
              have been proposed to explain how the left and right hippocampi
              contribute to behavior and cognition, these hypotheses have
              either been refuted by more recent studies or have been limited

              that the left and right hippocampi contribute to spatial memory

              hemisphere stores spatial information as discrete, salient
              locations, and the right hemisphere represents space
              continuously, contributing to route computation and flexible
              spatial navigation. Consideration of hippocampal lateralization

              brief historical review of these notions of brain connectivity, I
              argue that the conceptual formulations of functional and
              effective connectivity are far from clear. Specifically, the
              terms functional and effective connectivity are applied to
              quantities computed on types of functional imaging data (e.g.,
              PET, fMRI, EEG) that vary in spatial, temporal, and other
              features, using different definitions (even for data of the same
              modality) and employing different computational algorithms. Until
              it is understood what each definition means in terms of an
              underlying neural substrate, comparisons of functional and/or
              effective connectivity across studies may appear inconsistent and
              should be performed with great caution.",

  author   = "Soch, Joram and Allefeld, Carsten",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In cognitive neuroscience, functional magnetic
              resonance imaging (fMRI) data are widely analyzed using general
              linear models (GLMs). However, model quality of GLMs for fMRI is
              rarely assessed, in part due to the lack of formal measures for
              statistical model inference. NEW METHOD: We introduce a new SPM
              toolbox for model assessment, comparison and selection (MACS) of
              GLMs applied to fMRI data. MACS includes classical,
              information-theoretic and Bayesian methods of model assessment
              previously applied to GLMs for fMRI as well as recent
              methodological developments of model selection and model
              averaging in fMRI data analysis. RESULTS: The toolbox - which is
              freely available from GitHub - directly builds on the Statistical
              Parametric Mapping (SPM) software package and is easy-to-use,
              general-purpose, modular, readable and extendable. We validate
              the toolbox by reproducing model selection and model averaging
              results from earlier publications. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING
              METHODS: A previous toolbox for model diagnosis in fMRI has been
              discontinued and other approaches to model comparison between
              GLMs have not been translated into reusable computational
              resources in the past. CONCLUSIONS: Increased attention on model
              quality will lead to lower false-positive rates in cognitive
              neuroscience and increased application of the MACS toolbox will
              increase the reproducibility of GLM analyses and is likely to
              increase the replicability of fMRI studies.",

  abstract = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among
              mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the
              largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an
              overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain
              mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more
              glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify
              the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained
              mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies
              using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the
              brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and
              insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules
              apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer
              be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain.
              These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional
              in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many
              neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate
              brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped
              human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a
              fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what
              regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain
              does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains:
              compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as
              well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving
              scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among
              economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence
              containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a
              view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers
              of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call
              for a re-examination of several concepts related to the
              exceptionality of the human brain.",

               simultaneous temporal processing procedure. Rats were trained to
               time two stimuli (a light and a tone), each associated with a
               different fixed interval. Simple trials, in which a single

               session. Rats were able to divide attention between the two
               stimuli, as assessed by the pattern of lever presses.
               Approximately 50\% of lateral agranular neurons responded to at

               called a preferred direction (when motor) or a receptive field
               (when sensory). As we previously reported, some neurons in the
               monkey prefrontal cortex are tuned to two parts of space, which
               we interpreted as reflecting attention and working memory,

               attended to a visual stimulus at one location while remembering

               trial to assess spatial tuning. Most spatially tuned neurons
               specialized in either attentional or mnemonic processing, but
               about one-third of the cells showed tuning for both. Here, we

               usually differ (and often diametrically oppose one another), (2)
               they have stronger tuning than specialized cells, and (3) pairs

               To explore alternative interpretations of PF's delay-period

              Pashler, 1994). However, the extent to which brain regions
              embodying central mechanisms of information processing are amodal
              remains unclear. Here we apply multivariate pattern analysis to
              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to compare
              response selection, a cognitive process widely believed to
              recruit an amodal central resource across sensory and motor
              modalities. We show that most frontal and parietal cortical areas
              known to activate across a wide variety of tasks code modality,
              casting doubt on the notion that these regions embody a central
              processor devoid of modality representation. Importantly, regions
              of anterior insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
              consistently failed to code modality across four experiments.
              However, these areas code at least one other task dimension,
              process (instantiated as response selection vs response
              execution), ensuring that failure to find coding of modality is
              not driven by insensitivity of multivariate pattern analysis in
              these regions. We conclude that abstract encoding of information
              modality is primarily a property of subregions of the prefrontal

              response is blind to many important patterns of cortical
              modulation, which severely limits the formulation and evaluation
              of linking hypotheses between neural activity, BOLD responses,
              and behavior. More recently, multivariate pattern classification
              analysis (MVPA) has been applied to fMRI data to evaluate the
              information content of spatially distributed activation patterns.
              This approach has been remarkably successful at detecting the
              presence of specific information in targeted brain regions, and
              provides an extremely flexible means of extracting that
              information without a precise generative model for the underlying
              neural activity. However, this flexibility comes at a cost: since
              MVPA relies on pooling information across voxels that are
              selective for many different stimulus attributes, it is difficult
              to infer how specific sub-sets of tuned neurons are modulated by
              an experimental manipulation. In contrast, recently developed
              encoding models can produce more precise estimates of
              feature-selective tuning functions, and can support the creation
              of explicit linking hypotheses between neural activity and
              behavior. Although these encoding models depend on strong - and
              often untested - assumptions about the response properties of
              underlying neural generators, they also provide a unique

              Many views of brain function emphasize modularity, with different

              information. However, recent accounts also highlight flexibility,
              pointing especially to the highly consistent pattern of
              frontoparietal activation across many tasks. Although early
              insights from functional imaging were based on overall activation
              levels during different cognitive operations, in the last decade
              many researchers have used multivoxel pattern analyses to
              interrogate the representational content of activations, mapping
              out the brain regions that make particular stimulus, rule, or
              response distinctions. Here, we drew on 100 searchlight decoding
              analyses from 57 published papers to characterize the information
              coded in different brain networks. The outcome was highly

              these regions dynamically adjust their responses to selectively
              process information that is currently relevant for behavior, as
              proposed by the ``adaptive coding hypothesis'' [Duncan, J. An

              thought to support this process by adjusting to code information
              that is currently relevant (Duncan 2010). Accordingly, the
              network is proposed to encode a range of different types of
              information, including perceptual stimuli, task rules, and
              responses, as needed for the current cognitive operation.
              However, most MD research has used visual tasks, leaving limited

              minimizing effects related to task-preparatory processes, we
              employed a blocked event-related design in which single trials
              and dual trials were randomly and unpredictably intermixed for
              one block (mixed block) and presented in isolation of one another
              during other blocks (pure blocks). Any differences between
              dual-task and single-task trials within the mixed block would be
              related to dual-task performance while minimizing any effects
              related to preparatory differences between the conditions. For
              this comparison, we found dual-task-related activation throughout
              inferior prefrontal, temporal, extrastriate, and parietal
              cortices and the basal ganglia. In addition, when comparing the
              single task within the mixed block with the single task presented
              in the pure block of trials, the regions involved in processes
              important in the mixed block yet unrelated to dual-task
              operations could be specified. In this comparison, we report a
              pattern of activation in right inferior prefrontal and superior

              regions remain active during dual-task performance even after
              minimizing task-preparatory processes, but some regions
              implicated in dual-task performance in previous studies may have
              been due to task-preparation processes. Furthermore, our results
              suggest that dual-task operations activate the same brain areas
              as the single tasks, but to a greater magnitude than the single
              tasks. These results are discussed in relation to current
              conceptions of the neural correlates of dual-task performance.",

               is the occurrence of interference when participants attempt to
               perform two tasks at the same time. Such interference has been
               studied for a long time with so-called overlapping dual tasks,
               where two stimuli presented in rapid succession require separate
               responses. As an indicator of interference, reaction times on
               the second stimulus increase the smaller the interval between
               both tasks. While most behavioral studies investigated the
               temporal dynamics of the interference, we focused on the
               functional neuroanatomy of overlapping dual-task performance by
               using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants
               were asked to perform two choice reaction tasks concurrently
               [Pashler, Psychol. Bull., 116 (1994) 220-244]. When activation

               the prefrontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices was

               dual-task performance decrements in the PRP paradigm are
               referred to as PRP interference. The standard response-selection
               bottleneck (RSB) models state that the response-selection stage

               finishes before selection of the latter begins. Contrary to this
               conception, the authors found backward response-level crosstalk
               effects in which Task 2 response force requirements influenced
               the force-time dynamics of Task 1 responses. Specifically, Task
               2 required a hard or soft keypress response. Task 1 responses
               were harder when the upcoming Task 2 response was to press hard
               rather than soft, suggesting some activation of Task 2 response
               parameters before Task 1 processing reached the final ballistic
               motor output stage. A 3rd experiment using a flankers paradigm
               showed that this effect did not arise from automatic activation
               of responses by the stimuli associated with hard and soft
               responses. This backward response-level crosstalk extends
               previous findings of backward crosstalk in the PRP paradigm by

               characteristics of Task 2 of 2 subsequently performed tasks

               certain features of the second response are already activated to

               the exact locus of the BCE within the stages of task processing,
               5 experiments were carried out. Experiments 1 to 4 were
               psychological refractory period-like experiments with 3
               subsequent tasks. A prebottleneck locus of the BCE was ruled out
               in Experiments 1 to 3 by using the locus of slack logic.
               Additionally, a postbottleneck locus of the BCE was ruled out in
               Experiment 4 by using the effect propagation logic. To further
               support this latter conclusion, Experiment 5 applied a go-signal
               manipulation. Taken together, the results of all 5 experiments
               strongly suggest that the BCE has its locus in the
               capacity-limited stage, which contradicts the widely accepted
               notion that a capacity-unlimited stage of response activation

              previous action has been completed. The bottleneck is usually
              attributed to a limitation that prevents concurrent selection of
              two responses. However, evidence reviewed here challenges this
              selection interpretation. We propose instead that the bottleneck
              is due to a process that programs the timing of response
              initiation, and which must be completed immediately prior to
              responding. This hypothesis is based on two conclusions from
              recent developments in research, which includes findings from
              paradigms that do not involve the PRP. The first conclusion is
              from studies involving the startle response and single-task
              simple (precued) reaction time; these studies indicate that
              programming the timing of response onsets is needed to enable
              response initiation. This programing takes longer for more
              complicated timing, and must be delayed until just prior to
              responding. The second conclusion is from studies of concurrent
              rhythmic movements demonstrating that the representation of
              timing is restricted to one temporal frame unless very rapid
              performance enables parallel timing. These findings reveal
              limitations that can combine to produce the PRP bottleneck. This
              interpretation clarifies otherwise puzzling aspects of the PRP

              response timing may underlie both limitations and the PRP effect

              that paradigm and that were used to support the model are also
              consistent with a simple resource model. The most prominent
              findings are the millisecond-for-millisecond slope at the left of
              the RT2-SOA curve, the high RT1-RT2 correlation, the additivity
              of the effects on RT2 of SOA and of the difficulty of selecting
              R2, and the washout of the effect of S2 discriminability on RT2
              in a dual-task condition. In addition, the asymmetry of the
              effects of the dual-task requirement on RT1 and RT2 can be
              accounted for by the resource model provided that it assumes
              uneven allocation of resources, which is quite reasonable in view
              of the task asymmetry inherent in the demand characteristics of
              the paradigm. The same is true for two other findings that appear
              to support the single-bottleneck model-that in the dual-task
              condition, the demand of the first task affects equally RT1 and
              RT2 and that its effect on RT1 is the same as the corresponding
              effect in the single-task condition. Furthermore, the
              single-bottleneck model is hard to reconcile with a negative
              slope at the left of the RT1-SOA curve or a positive slope at the
              left of the IRI-SOA curve, unless augmented by ancillary

              responses to both may implicitly equate their importance. In
              real-life driving, however, the potential for collision dictates
              that a concurrent task should be assigned far lower priority than
              driving. To better reflect naturalistic driving conditions, we
              not only instructed participants to assign maximum priority to
              braking in a simulated driving task, but also encouraged them to
              ignore the concurrent task altogether on dual-task trials.
              Despite these instructions, responses to the concurrent task
              often preceded braking, which suffered from dual-task
              interference. We also found that redundant signals to the lead

              different types of secondary tasks (answering trivia questions
              and solving math problems). Reading comprehension was assessed
              using a multiple-choice test that measured both factual and

              detrimental effects associated with multitasking. In Experiment

              research tool in the literature on dual-task performance. In this
              paradigm a first and second component task (i.e., Task 1 and Task
              2) are presented with variable stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs)
              and priority to perform Task 1. The main indicator of dual-task
              impairment in PRP situations is an increasing Task 2-RT with
              decreasing SOAs. This impairment is typically explained with some
              task components being processed strictly sequentially in the
              context of the prominent central bottleneck theory. This
              assumption could implicitly suggest that processes of Task 1 are
              unaffected by Task 2 and bottleneck processing, i.e., decreasing
              SOAs do not increase reaction times (RTs) and error rates of the
              first task. The aim of the present review is to assess whether
              PRP dual-task studies included both RT and error data
              presentations and statistical analyses and whether studies
              including both data types (i.e., RTs and error rates) show data
              consistent with this assumption (i.e., decreasing SOAs and
              unaffected RTs and/or error rates in Task 1). This review
              demonstrates that, in contrast to RT presentations and analyses,
              error data is underrepresented in a substantial number of

              processing in the context of PRP dual-task situations; this calls

              is typically caused by a single-channel bottleneck, but the
              processing locus of the bottleneck has yet to be pinned down. A
              bottleneck locus at the response-selection stage is widely
              advocated, but an earlier locus would be consistent with most
              previous evidence. Four new experiments used the ``locus of
              slack'' method to investigate whether the stages postponed by the
              central bottleneck include stimulus classification, a very late
              stage of perceptual processing. The experiments varied stimulus
              classification difficulty for two different analogueue perceptual
              judgements. Experiment 1 found only modest absorption into slack
              for the difficulty of a spatial position judgement. Experiments
              2-4 found virtually no absorption into slack for the difficulty
              of a box-width judgement. These results support a bottleneck
              locus beginning at or before the stage of stimulus classification

              evidence, however, leaves no doubt that response selection is
              also subject to bottleneck postponement. Two architectures are

              whether costs result from limitations in central capacity, and
              whether central operations can be performed in parallel. While
              these questions are controversial, the dominant models of
              dual-task performance share the assumption that central
              operations are generic--that is, their interactions are
              independent of stimulus and response modalities. To examine these
              issues, we conducted a series of dual-task experiments with
              different input and output modality pairings. One condition
              combined a visual-manual task with an auditory-vocal task, and
              the other condition reversed the input-output pairings, combining
              a visual-vocal task with an auditory-manual task. Input/output
              modality pairings proved to be a key factor; throughout practice,
              dual-task costs were generally more than twice as large with
              visual-vocal/auditory-manual tasks than with the opposite
              arrangement of modalities (Experiments 1 and 2). These
              differences could be explained neither by competition for
              peripheral resources nor by differences in single-task response
              times (Experiment 3). Moreover, the persistent dual-task costs
              did not appear to stem from a central bottleneck. Contrary to the
              dominant models of dual-task performance, we propose that central
              interference between tasks depends not just on the duration of
              central operations, nor just strategic adaptation, but also on
              the content of those operations. Implications for structural and

               The representation proposed here is based upon segmenting a
               movement at moments when a component axis, e.g. an arm, starts
               to move relative to its local coordinate frame (here the torso).

               motions between the stationary points (relative to the torso,

              inferior parietal and frontal cortices, anterior insula, premotor
              cortex, putamen and cerebellum, i.e., a 'ventral'

              than a few-and usually only a single-control-demanding task at a
              time. This limitation was a defining element in the earliest
              conceptualizations of controlled processing; it remains one of
              the most widely accepted axioms of cognitive psychology, and is
              even the basis for some laws (e.g., against the use of mobile

              additionally provided estimates of their RTs (introspective
              reaction times, IRTs) after each trial (Experiment 1) or after
              each pair of prime and test trials (Experiment 2). In both
              experiments, the objective performance showed the typical
              backward crosstalk effect and its sequential modulation depending
              on compatibility in the previous trial. Very similar patterns
              were observed in IRTs, despite the typical unawareness of the PRP
              effect. In sum, these results demonstrate the reliability of
              between-task crosstalk in dual tasks and that people's

               statements:? (a) The response to a signal arriving during the
               reaction time to a former signal will be delayed by an amount
               approximately equal to the time elapsing between the arrival of

               signal. (b) An exception to this may occur when two signals
               arrive close together. In this case the two signals may be
               responded to as a single group. (c) Delays can be occasioned by

              decision is often assumed to be inconsequential to the
              hemodynamic response (HDR) in rapid event-related designs. On
              this basis, the majority of published studies model brain
              activity lasting less than 4 s with brief impulses representing
              the onset of neural or cognitive events, which are then convolved
              with the hemodynamic impulse response function (HRF). However,
              electrophysiological studies have shown that decision-related
              neuronal activity is not instantaneous, but in fact, often lasts
              until the motor response. It is therefore possible that small
              differences in neural processing durations, similar to human RTs,
              will produce noticeable changes in the HDR, and therefore in the

              attention to goal-relevant information. Due to the central role
              that WM plays in general cognition, it has become the focus of a
              rapidly growing training literature that seeks to affect broad
              cognitive change through prolonged training on WM tasks. Recent
              work has suggested that the effects of WM training extend to
              general fluid intelligence, attentional control, and reductions
              in symptoms of ADHD. We present a theoretically motivated
              perspective of WM and subsequently review the WM training
              literature in light of several concerns. These include (a) the
              tendency for researchers to define change to abilities using
              single tasks, (b) inconsistent use of valid WM tasks, (c)

              need to directly demonstrate that WM capacity increases in

              tasks, thus eliminating the possibility that results can be
              explained by task specific learning. Additionally, we express

              to control for the possibility that improvement by the
              experimental group resulted from a placebo effect. Although
              active control groups are superior to ``no-contact'' controls,
              only when the active control group has the same expectation of
              improvement as the experimental group can we attribute
              differential improvements to the potency of the treatment.
              Despite the need to match expectations between treatment and
              control groups, almost no psychological interventions do so. This
              failure to control for expectations is not a minor omission-it is
              a fundamental design flaw that potentially undermines any causal
              inference. We illustrate these principles with a detailed example
              from the video-game-training literature showing how the use of an
              active control group does not eliminate expectation differences.
              The problem permeates other interventions as well, including
              those targeting mental health, cognition, and educational

  author   = "Barbaro, Ludwig and Peelen, Marius V and Hickey, Clayton",
  abstract = "Objects associated with reward draw attention and evoke enhanced
              activity in visual cortex. What is the underlying mechanism? One
              possibility is that reward's impact on vision is mediated by
              unique circuitry that modulates sensory processing, selectively
              increasing the salience of reward-associated stimuli.
              Alternatively, effects of reward may be part of a more general
              mechanism that prioritizes the processing of any beneficial
              object, importantly including stimuli that are associated with
              the evasion of loss. Here, we test these competing hypotheses by
              having male and female humans detect naturalistic objects
              associated with monetary reward, the evasion of equivalent loss,
              or neither of these. If vision is economically normative,
              processing of objects associated with reward and evasion of loss
              should be prioritized relative to neutral stimuli. Results from
              fMRI and behavioral experiments show that this is not the case:
              whereas objects associated with reward were better detected and
              represented in ventral visual cortex, detection and
              representation of stimuli associated with the evasion of loss
              were degraded. Representations in parietal cortex reveal a
              notable exception to this pattern, showing enhanced encoding of
              both reward- and loss-associated stimuli. Experience-driven
              visual prioritization can thus be economically irrational, driven
              by valence rather than objective utility.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT
              Normative economic models propose that gain should have the same
              value as evasion of equivalent loss. Is human vision rational in
              this way? Objects associated with reward draw attention and are
              well represented in visual cortex. This is thought to have
              evolutionary origins, highlighting objects likely to provide
              benefit in the future. But benefit can be conferred not only
              through gain, but also through evasion of loss. Here we
              demonstrate that the visual system prioritizes real-world objects
              presented in images of natural scenes only when these objects
              have been associated with reward, not when they have provided the
              opportunity to evade financial loss. Visual selection is thus
              non-normative and economically irrational, driven by valence

              speeded reaction time and movement time, and abolished the

              The overall mean reaction time to contralateral stimuli was not

              faster and more accurate compared to equally relevant but less
              valuable stimuli. Conversely, task irrelevant stimuli that were
              previously associated with a high reward can capture attention
              and distract processing away from relevant stimuli (e.g. the
              chocolate bar in the pantry when you are looking for a nice
              healthy apple). While increasing the value of task-relevant
              stimuli systematically up-regulates neural responses in early
              visual cortex to facilitate information processing, it is not
              clear if the value of task-irrelevant distractors influences
              behavior via competition in early visual cortex or via
              competition at later stages of decision-making and response

              demonstrate that this attentional bias towards predictive stimuli
              is at least partially under voluntary control and can be flexibly
              adapted via instruction. Our experiment took a similar approach

              trial-by-trial training; we then provided explicit verbal

              their learning about stimuli, and their memory for instructions.
              Overall, these findings suggest that rapid attentional biases

              attention. But do these various factors influence spatial
              attention in the same manner, as suggested by the integrated
              framework of attention, or do they target different aspects of
              spatial attention? Here I present evidence that the control of
              attention may be implemented in two ways. Whereas current goals
              typically modulate where in space attention is prioritized,
              search habits affect how one moves attention in space. Using the
              location probability learning paradigm, I show that a search
              habit forms when people frequently find a visual search target in
              one region of space. Attentional cuing by probability learning
              differs from that by current goals. Probability cuing is implicit
              and persists long after the probability cue is no longer valid.
              Whereas explicit goal-driven attention codes space in an

              Similar to the integrated framework, the multi-level framework

              ongoing processing of retinal input in order for selected
              representations to gain privileged access to perceptual awareness
              and guide behavior. Enhanced analysis of currently relevant or
              otherwise salient information is often accompanied by suppressed
              processing of the less relevant or salient input. Recent findings
              indicate that rewards exert a powerful influence on the
              deployment of visual selective attention. Such influence takes
              different forms depending on the specific protocol adopted in the
              given study. In some cases, the prospect of earning a larger
              reward in relation to a specific stimulus or location biases
              attention accordingly in order to maximize overall gain. This is
              mediated by an effect of reward acting as a type of incentive
              motivation for the strategic control of attention. In contrast,
              reward delivery can directly alter the processing of specific
              stimuli by increasing their attentional priority, and this can be
              measured even when rewards are no longer involved, reflecting a
              form of reward-mediated attentional learning. As a further
              development, recent work demonstrates that rewards can affect
              attentional learning in dissociable ways depending on whether
              rewards are perceived as feedback on performance or instead are
              registered as random-like events occurring during task
              performance. Specifically, it appears that visual selective
              attention is shaped by two distinct reward-related learning
              mechanisms: one requiring active monitoring of performance and
              outcome, and a second one detecting the sheer association between
              objects in the environment (whether attended or ignored) and the
              more-or-less rewarding events that accompany them. Overall this
              emerging literature demonstrates unequivocally that rewards
              ``teach'' visual selective attention so that processing resources
              will be allocated to objects, features and locations which are
              likely to optimize the organism's interaction with the

              control and present evidence supporting the view that similar
              mechanisms operate in the two processes. A computational model of
              attention is presented that uses habituation as well as classical
              and instrumental conditioning to explain a number of attentional
              processes. Evidence from neurophysiology is reviewed that suggest
              that attention is controlled in a way similar to actions. This
              view makes it possible to adapt traditional learning theoretical
              mechanisms to the control of attention. Computer simulations are
              presented that illustrate the operation of the model. (PsycINFO

              alternative proposal, however, is that attention acts to reduce
              uncertainty about target location, thereby increasing accuracy by
              decreasing the number of noise sources. To distinguish between
              these alternatives, we conducted 6 spatial cuing experiments in
              which target location uncertainty was eliminated. Despite the

              orientation discrimination (Experiments 1-4), detection
              (Experiments 2 and 3) and localization (Experiment 3) tasks. In
              all four experiments the target (a Gabor patch ranging in spatial

              stimuli (stimulus-driven attention) [3-5], and selection history
              [6-12]. This third construct, which encompasses reward learning,
              aversive conditioning, and repetitive orienting behavior [12-18],
              is often characterized as a unitary mechanism of control that can
              be contrasted with the other two [12-14]. Here, we present
              evidence that two different learning processes underlie the
              influence of selection history on attention, with dissociable
              consequences for orienting behavior. Human observers performed an
              antisaccade task in which they were paid for shifting their gaze
              in the direction opposite one of two color-defined targets.
              Strikingly, such training resulted in a bias to do the opposite
              of what observers were motivated and paid to do, with associative
              learning facilitating orienting toward reward cues. On the other

              repeat this behavior even when it conflicted with current goals,
              reflecting instrumental conditioning of the orienting response.
              Our findings challenge the idea that selection history reflects a
              common mechanism of learning-dependent priority and instead
              suggest multiple distinct routes by which learning history shapes

              its neural correlates. Here, we adapt a cueing task to measure
              spatial cueing effects on the decisions of honeybees and compare
              their behavior to that of humans and monkeys in a similarly
              structured two-alternative forced-choice perceptual task. Unlike
              the typical cueing paradigm in which the stimulus strength
              remains unchanged within a block of trials, for the monkey and
              human studies we randomized the contrast of the signal to
              simulate more real world conditions in which the organism is
              uncertain about the strength of the signal. A Bayesian ideal
              observer that weights sensory evidence from cued and uncued
              locations based on the cue validity to maximize overall
              performance is used as a benchmark of comparison against the
              three animals and other suboptimal models: probability matching,
              ignore the cue, always follow the cue, and an additive
              bias/single decision threshold model. We find that the cueing
              effect is pervasive across all three species but is smaller in
              size than that shown by the Bayesian ideal observer. Humans show
              a larger cueing effect than monkeys and bees show the smallest
              effect. The cueing effect and overall performance of the
              honeybees allows rejection of the models in which the bees are
              ignoring the cue, following the cue and disregarding stimuli to
              be discriminated, or adopting a probability matching strategy.
              Stimulus strength uncertainty also reduces the theoretically
              predicted variation in cueing effect with stimulus strength of an
              optimal Bayesian observer and diminishes the size of the cueing
              effect when stimulus strength is low. A more biologically
              plausible model that includes an additive bias to the sensory
              response from the cued location, although not mathematically
              equivalent to the optimal observer for the case stimulus strength
              uncertainty, can approximate the benefits of the more
              computationally complex optimal Bayesian model. We discuss the
              implications of our findings on the field's common
              conceptualization of covert visual attention in the cueing task

              more salient than targets with only one of these properties, but
              often less salient than predicted from the sum of the individual

  abstract = "A crucial question for the analysis of multi-subject and/or
              multi-session electroencephalographic (EEG) data is how to
              combine information across multiple recordings from different
              subjects and/or sessions, each associated with its own set of
              source processes and scalp projections. Here we introduce a novel
              statistical method for characterizing the spatial consistency of
              EEG dynamics across a set of data records. Measure Projection
              Analysis (MPA) first finds voxels in a common template brain
              space at which a given dynamic measure is consistent across
              nearby source locations, then computes local-mean EEG measure
              values for this voxel subspace using a statistical model of
              source localization error and between-subject anatomical
              variation. Finally, clustering the mean measure voxel values in
              this locally consistent brain subspace finds brain spatial
              domains exhibiting distinguishable measure features and provides
              3-D maps plus statistical significance estimates for each EEG
              measure of interest. Applied to sufficient high-quality data, the
              scalp projections of many maximally independent component (IC)
              processes contributing to recorded high-density EEG data closely
              match the projection of a single equivalent dipole located in or
              near brain cortex. We demonstrate the application of MPA to a
              multi-subject EEG study decomposed using independent component
              analysis (ICA), compare the results to k-means IC clustering in
              EEGLAB (sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), and use surrogate data to test MPA
              robustness. A Measure Projection Toolbox (MPT) plug-in for EEGLAB
              is available for download (sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/MPT). Together, MPA

              a popular open-source toolbox that provides many EEG
              preprocessing steps and an excellent user interface design.
              ERPLAB adds to EEGLAB's EEG processing functions, providing
              additional tools for filtering, artifact detection,
              re-referencing, and sorting of events, among others. ERPLAB also
              provides robust tools for averaging EEG segments together to
              create averaged ERPs, for creating difference waves and other
              recombinations of ERP waveforms through algebraic expressions,
              for filtering and re-referencing the averaged ERPs, for plotting
              ERP waveforms and scalp maps, and for quantifying several types
              of amplitudes and latencies. ERPLAB's tools can be accessed
              either from an easy-to-learn graphical user interface or from
              MATLAB scripts, and a command history function makes it easy for
              users with no programming experience to write scripts.
              Consequently, ERPLAB provides both ease of use and virtually
              unlimited power and flexibility, making it appropriate for the

              of posterior neural oscillations in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and gamma

              relevant information to be selectively processed has its
              advantages, it may lead to lucrative or dangerous information
              going unnoticed. Neural systems are also in place for processing
              rewarding and punishing information. Here, we examine the
              interaction between selective attention (left vs. right) and
              stimulus's learned value associations (neutral, punished, or
              rewarded) and how they compete for control of posterior neural
              oscillations. We found that both attention and stimulus-value
              associations influenced neural oscillations. Whereas selective
              attention had comparable effects on alpha and gamma oscillations,
              value associations had dissociable effects on these neural
              markers of attention. Salient targets (associated with positive
              and negative outcomes) hijacked changes in alpha power-increasing
              hemispheric alpha lateralization when salient targets were

              occipital generators of both attentional and value effects. Thus,
              posterior cortical oscillations support both the ability to
              selectively attend while at the same time retaining the ability
              to remain sensitive to valuable features in the environment.
              Moreover, the versatility of our attentional system to respond
              separately to salient from merely positively valued stimuli

              Such multitasking costs are thought to largely reflect capacity
              limits in response selection (Welford, 1952; Pashler, 1984,
              1994), the information processing stage at which sensory input is
              mapped to a motor response. Neuroimaging has implicated the left
              posterior lateral prefrontal cortex (pLPFC) as a key neural
              substrate of response selection (Dux et al., 2006, 2009; Ivanoff
              et al., 2009). For example, activity in left pLPFC tracks
              improvements in response selection efficiency typically observed
              following training (Dux et al., 2009). To date, however, there
              has been no causal evidence that pLPFC contributes directly to
              sensory-motor training effects, or the operations through which
              training occurs. Moreover, the left hemisphere lateralization of
              this operation remains controversial (Jiang and Kanwisher, 2003;
              Sigman and Dehaene, 2008; Verbruggen et al., 2010). We used

              anodal and cathodal stimulation of the left pLPFC disrupted
              training effects for the high load condition relative to sham. No
              disruption was found for the low load and right pLPFC stimulation
              conditions. The findings implicate the left pLPFC in both
              response selection and training effects. They also suggest that
              training improves response selection efficiency by fine-tuning
              activity in pLPFC relating to sensory-motor translations.",

              (additive hypothesis), whereas neuroeconomic studies posit that
              they may be multiplicatively combined (expected value

              are available to visual prioritization mechanisms, but that their
              use is context dependent (mixed operations hypothesis).
              Participants viewed two coloured placeholders that specified the
              potential value of correctly identifying an imminent letter
              target if it appeared in that placeholder. Then, prior to the
              target9s presentation, an endogenous spatial cue was presented
              indicating the target9s more likely location. Spatial cues were
              parametrically manipulated with regard to the information gained
              (in bits). Across two experiments, response time and accuracy
              were greater for targets appearing in high versus low value

  abstract = "In order to learn efficiently, organisms must learn how to
              distribute their attention to the available cues. Traditionally,
              most experiments on attention learning have involved discrete
              outcomes (e.g. no food vs. one food pellet, or category A vs.
              category B). A basic finding is that cues receive attention in
              proportion to how well they predict such outcomes. However, more
              recent research has shown an apparently independent effect of
              outcome value on attention (Le Pelley, Mitchell, \& Johnson,
              2013\}, in which cues associated with large rewards receive more
              attention than those associated with small rewards. It has been
              suggested that a separate derived attention mechanism - in which
              attention is based directly on association strength - is
              necessary to explain this result (Le Pelley, Mitchell, Beesley,
              George, \& Wills, 2016). As our primary experimental
              contribution, we use modified versions of this design to
              replicate the value effect and show that it can be reversed by
              manipulating the rewards given for incorrect choices. Our
              simulations show that CompAct - a model in which cues compete for
              attention on the basis of their relative predictiveness - can
              account for both of our empirical results. The derived attention
              theory, in contrast, incorrectly predicts that cues associated
              with large rewards will always receive more attention. We
              conclude that we do not need separate mechanisms to account for

              attended features that are not associated with reward. Here, we
              use magnetoencephalography in human observers to investigate
              whether the modulations indexing global color-based selection in
              visual cortex are separable for target- and (monetary)
              reward-defining colors. To assess the underlying global
              color-based activity modulation, we compare the event-related
              magnetic field response elicited by a color probe in the
              unattended hemifield drawn either in the target color, the reward
              color, both colors, or a neutral task-irrelevant color. To test
              whether target and reward relevance trigger separable
              modulations, we manipulate attention demands on target selection
              while keeping reward-defining experimental parameters constant.
              Replicating previous observations, we find that reward and target
              relevance produce almost indistinguishable gain modulations in
              ventral extratriate cortex contralateral to the unattended color
              probe. Importantly, increasing attention demands on target
              discrimination increases the response to the target-defining
              color, whereas the response to the rewarded color remains largely
              unchanged. These observations indicate that, although task
              relevance and reward influence the very same feature-selective

              has been proposed that the extinction of probabilistic rewards

              Midbrain dopamine neurons were suggested to play a role in both
              arousal and learning reward values. Despite extensive research on
              modeling dopaminergic activity in reward learning (e.g. temporal
              difference models), few studies have been done on modeling its
              role in arousal. Although temporal difference models capture key
              characteristics of dopaminergic activity during the extinction of
              deterministic rewards, they have been less successful at
              simulating the extinction of probabilistic rewards. By adding an

              to focus on task-relevant information without being blindsided by
              unexpected, yet important information. The human visual system
              incorporates several solutions to this challenge, one of which is
              a reflexive covert attention system that is rapidly responsive to
              both the physical salience and the task-relevance of new
              information. This paper presents a model that simulates
              behavioral and neural correlates of reflexive attention as the
              product of brief neural attractor states that are formed across
              the visual hierarchy at the moment when attention is engaged.
              Such attractors emerge from an attentional gradient distributed
              over a population of topographically organized neurons and serve
              to focus processing at one or more locations in the visual field,
              while inhibiting the processing of lower priority information.
              The model resolves key debates about the nature of reflexive
              attention, such as whether it is parallel or serial, and whether
              suppression effects are distributed in a spatial surround, or
              selectively at the location of distractors. Most importantly, the

              modeling of psychophysical data with fMRI to characterize the
              computational and neural mechanisms underlying this flexible
              attentional control. Sixteen healthy human subjects performed a
              modified version of Posner's location-cueing paradigm in which
              the percentage of cue validity varied in time and the targets
              required saccadic responses. Trialwise estimates of the certainty
              (precision) of the prediction that the target would appear at the
              cued location were derived from a hierarchical Bayesian model
              fitted to individual trialwise saccadic response speeds.
              Trial-specific model parameters then entered analyses of fMRI
              data as parametric regressors. Moreover, dynamic causal modeling
              (DCM) was performed to identify the most likely functional
              architecture of the attentional reorienting network and its
              modulation by (Bayes-optimal) precision-dependent attention.
              While the frontal eye fields (FEFs), intraparietal sulcus, and

              responses in right FEF, TPJ, and the putamen were significantly
              modulated by precision-dependent attention. Our DCM results
              suggested that the precision of predictability underlies the
              attentional modulation of the coupling of TPJ with FEF and the
              putamen. Our results shed new light on the computational

              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Spatial attention and its neural
              correlates in the human brain have been studied extensively with
              the help of fMRI and cueing paradigms in which the location of
              targets is pre-cued on a trial-by-trial basis. One aspect that
              has so far been neglected concerns the question of how the brain
              forms attentional expectancies when no a priori probability
              information is available but needs to be inferred from
              observations. This study elucidates the computational and neural
              mechanisms under which probabilistic inference governs
              attentional deployment. Our results show that Bayesian belief
              updating explains changes in cortical connectivity; in that
              directional influences from the temporoparietal junction on the
              frontal eye fields and the putamen were modulated by

              ``priority'' maps that highlight attention-worthy locations, and
              provide top-down feedback for motor orienting and attentional

              making are naturally coordinated, in the laboratory they have
              been dissociated. Attention is studied independently of the

                   Will these learning rules also generalize to networks with

                   Here, we demonstrate that these learning schemes indeed

              in this function, responding strongly to explicit reward
              feedback. However, recent results have also shown striatal
              activity following correct task performance even in the absence
              of feedback. This raises the possibility that, in addition to
              processing external feedback, the dopamine-centered ``reward
              circuit'' might regulate endogenous reinforcement signals, like
              those triggered by satisfaction in accurate task performance.
              Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test
              this idea. Participants completed a simple task that garnered
              both reward feedback and feedback about the precision of
              performance. Importantly, the design was such that we could
              manipulate information about the precision of performance within
              different levels of reward magnitude. Using parametric modulation

              evidence suggests that their mechanisms extend to the domain of
              attentional switching. We here investigated the subcortical
              involvement in reward related top-down control of visual
              alpha-band oscillations (8-13 Hz), which have been consistently
              linked to the mechanisms supporting the allocation of visual
              spatial attention. Given that items associated with contextual
              saliency (e.g. monetary reward or loss) attract attention, it is
              not surprising that alpha oscillations are further modulated by
              the saliency properties of the visual items. The executive
              network controlling such reward-dependent modulations of
              oscillatory brain activity has yet to be fully elucidated.
              Although it has been explored in terms of cortico-cortical
              interaction, such network likely relies also on the contribution

              predict interhemispheric modulation of alpha power during a

              unexpected stimuli, confounding reorienting and expectation. We
              separately measured the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal
              for both factors by manipulating the probability of salient
              visual cues that either shifted attention away from or maintained
              attention on a stream of visual stimuli. The results
              distinguished three networks recruited by reorienting. Right
              temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the posterior core of a ventral
              frontoparietal network, was activated more by cues for shifting
              than maintaining attention independently of cue location and
              probability, acting as a switch. TPJ was separately modulated by
              low probability cues, which signaled a breach of spatial
              expectation, independently of whether they shifted attention.
              Under resting conditions, TPJ activity was correlated
              [resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance
              imaging, (rs-fcMRI)] with right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), an
              anterior component of the ventral network. Nevertheless, IFG was
              activated only by unexpected shifts of attention, dissociating
              its function from TPJ. Basal ganglia and frontal/insula regions
              also were activated only when reorienting was unexpected but
              showed strong rs-fcMRI among themselves, not with TPJ/IFG,

              (FEF), and transient less selective modulations in precuneus and

              whether the BG also contribute to one or the other of these
              mechanisms, or to both. The current study was principally
              undertaken to clarify this issue. Parkinson disease (PD), a

              to be an effective model for investigating the contribution of
              the BG to different brain functions; therefore, we set out to
              investigate deficits of top-down and bottom-up attention in a
              selected cohort of PD patients. With this objective in mind, we
              compared the performance on three computerized tasks of two
              groups of 12 parkinsonian patients (assessed without any
              treatment), one otherwise pharmacologically treated and the other
              also surgically treated, with that of a group of controls. The
              main behavioral tool for our study was an attentional capture
              task, which enabled us to tap the competition between top-down
              and bottom-up mechanisms of visual attention. This task was
              suitably combined with a choice RT and a simple RT task to
              isolate any specific deficit of attention from deficits in motor
              response selection and initiation. In the two groups of patients,
              we found an equivalent increase of attentional capture but also
              comparable delays in target selection in the absence of any

              operated patients. Our results confirm that the BG are involved
              in both motor and cognitive domains. Specifically, damage to the
              BG, as it occurs in PD, leads to a distinct deficit of top-down
              control of visual attention, and this can account, albeit
              indirectly, for the enhancement of attentional capture,
              reflecting weakened ability of top-down mechanisms to antagonize
              bottom-up control.",

  abstract = "Spatial cueing is one of the most robust effects in cognitive
              psychology and has been thought for decades to indicate the
              resource limits of the visual attention system given that
              invalidly cued items are processed less efficiently than neutral
              ones. However, limited resource accounts cannot explain findings
              of dividing attention without yielding noticeable costs as well
              as findings showing benefits without costs in spatial cueing. The
              current study presents a new account of cueing effects, namely
              the memory encoding cost (MEC) theory, which integrates attention
              and memory encoding effects in an explanation of the costs and
              benefits evoked by a spatial cue. Unlike previous theories that
              focused only on the role of attention in yielding spatial cueing
              effects, the MEC theory argues that cueing effects are driven by
              two distinct mechanisms: attentional facilitation and a memory
              encoding cost. That is, the cost of an invalid cue as measured by
              target report is entirely or at least partially driven by memory
              encoding of the cue which extends across the entire visual field,
              while the benefit of a valid cue is the net effect of a
              combination of this encoding cost, and a spatiotopic attentional
              facilitation. The crucial implication of this theory is that
              attention may be unlimited despite the observation of invalidity
              costs. MEC generates a number of predictions that we test here,
              providing three convergent lines of evidence for such encoding
              costs in cueing paradigms. Furthermore, as the MEC suggests a
              common mechanism underlying cueing costs and the attentional
              blink, we simulated the core empirical findings of the current
              study by using an existing attentional blink model and found that
              the model was able to simulate them with manipulation of a single
              parameter that corresponds to memory encoding. The MEC theory
              thus simplifies our theoretical understanding of attentional
              effects by linking the attentional blink and spatial cueing costs
              to a common mechanism. The code and data for all of the reported

               limited resource accounts cannot explain certain findings, such
               as dividing attention without costs, or attentional benefits
               without invalidity costs. The current study presents a new
               account of exogenous cueing, namely the memory encoding cost
               (MEC) theory, which integrates attention and memory encoding to
               explain costs and benefits evoked by a spatial cue. Unlike
               conventional theories that focus on the role of attention in
               yielding spatial cueing effects, the MEC theory argues that some
               cueing effects are caused by a combination of attentional

  abstract = "Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) EEG activity has been linked to visual
              attention since the earliest EEG studies. More recent studies
              using spatial cuing paradigms have shown that alpha is suppressed
              over the hemisphere contralateral to a to-be-attended location,
              suggesting that alpha serves as a mechanism of preparatory
              attention. Here, we demonstrate that alpha also plays a role in
              active target processing. EEG activity was recorded from a group
              of healthy male and female human subjects in two visual search
              experiments. In addition to alpha activity, we also assessed the
              N2pc event-related potential component, a lateralized transient
              EEG response that has been tightly linked with the focusing of
              attention on visual targets. We found that the visual search
              targets triggered both an N2pc component and a suppression of
              alpha-band activity that was greatest over the hemisphere
              contralateral to the target (which we call ``target-elicited
              lateralized alpha suppression'' or TELAS). In Experiment 1, both
              N2pc and TELAS were observed for targets presented in the lower
              visual field but were absent for upper-field targets. However,
              these two lateralized effects had different time courses and they
              responded differently to manipulations of crowding in Experiment
              2. These results indicate that lateralized alpha-band activity is
              involved in active target processing and is not solely a
              preparatory mechanism and also that TELAS and N2pc reflect a
              related but separable neural mechanism of visuospatial
              attention.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The very first EEG studies
              demonstrated that alpha-band (8-12 Hz) EEG oscillations are
              suppressed when people attend to visual information and more
              recent research has shown that cuing an individual to expect a
              target at a specific location produces lateralized suppression in
              the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, lateralized alpha may
              serve as a preparatory mechanism. In the present study, we found
              that a similar lateralized alpha effect is triggered by the
              appearance of a visual target even though the location could not
              be anticipated, demonstrating that alpha also serves as an active
              mechanism of target processing. Moreover, we found that alpha
              lateralization can be dissociated from other lateralized measures
              of target selection, indicating that it reflects a distinct
              mechanism of attention.",

              known to what extent it is also limited by the resolving power of
              attention. To investigate this, we studied adaptation to lines of
              specific orientation, a process that occurs in primary visual
              cortex. When a single grating is presented in the periphery of
              the visual field, human observers are aware of its orientation,
              but when it is flanked by other similar gratings ('crowding'),
              its orientation becomes impossible to discern. Nevertheless, we

              crowding, implying that spatial resolution is limited by an
              attentional filter acting beyond the primary visual cortex.
              Consistent with this, we find that attentional resolution is
              greater in the lower than in the upper visual field, whereas
              there is no corresponding asymmetry in the primary visual cortex.

              falls below a critical distance, target discrimination declines
              precipitously. This is called ``crowding.'' Many researchers have
              proposed that selective attention plays a role in crowding.
              However, although some research has examined the effects of
              directing attention toward versus away from the targets, no
              previous research has assessed how attentional allocation varies
              as a function of target-flanker distance in crowding. Here, we
              used ERPs to assess the operation of attention during crowding,
              focusing on the attention-related N2pc component. We used a
              typical crowding task in which participants were asked to report
              the category (vowel/consonant) of a lateralized target letter
              flanked by distractor letters at different distances. We tested
              the hypothesis that attention fails when the target-flanker
              distance becomes too small for attention to operate effectively.
              Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that N2pc amplitude was
              maximal at intermediate target-flanker distances and decreased
              substantially when crowding became severe. In addition, we
              examined the sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN),
              which reflects the amount of information being maintained in

              Together, the N2pc and SPCN results suggest that attention and
              working memory play distinctive roles in crowding: Attention
              operates to minimize interference from the flankers at
              intermediate target-flanker distances, whereas working memory may
              be recruited when attention fails to select the target at small

              simultaneously, as in the visual search paradigm, the neural
              coding of individual objects can become ambiguous due to the
              visual system's extensive use of coarse coding and distributed
              representations. Here we propose that the primary role of visual
              selective attention within the ventral object recognition pathway
              is to resolve these ambiguities. We begin by reviewing previous
              studies of the effects of attention on neural responses in
              monkeys, which provide the basis for this hypothesis, and then
              describe a new set of experiments showing that similar
              attentional mechanisms operate in the human brain. In these new
              experiments, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from
              normal human observers while they performed tasks analogous to
              those used previously in monkeys. The central finding was that an
              attention-related ERP wave called the ``N2pc component'' was
              present under the same conditions that led to attentional
              modulations of neural responses in monkey visual cortex. These

              (MEG/EEG) to examine real-time representation of the component
              processes of selective attention. Auditory cues instructed
              participants to respond to a particular visual target, embedded
              within a stream of single- and multi-item displays. Although the
              task logically required items to be compared to an attentional
              ``template'', signals consistent with such a template were
              relatively weak and appeared to transition through a quiescent
              state. Subsequent stimulus processing evoked strong neural
              representation of multiple target features, evolving over

              subtasks. Ullman suggested that such subtasks are carried out by
              elemental operations that are implemented by specialized
              processes in the visual brain [Ullman, S. (1984). Visual
              routines. Cognition (18), 97--159]. According to this hypothesis,
              there are a limited number of elemental operations that, since
              they can be applied sequentially, may nevertheless give rise to a
              large number of visual routines. Examples of such elemental

              operations are implemented in the visual brain. When an image

              pattern that is distributed across many visual areas. Thereafter,
              elemental operations come into play, and these are implemented by
              the modulation of firing rates. Firing rate modulations
              effectuate grouping of neural responses into coherent object
              representations. Moreover, they permit transfer of information

  abstract = "Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) electroencephalogram (EEG) activity has been
              linked to visual attention since the earliest EEG studies. More
              recent studies using spatial cuing paradigms have shown that
              alpha is suppressed over the hemisphere contralateral to a
              to-be-attended location, suggesting that alpha serves as a
              mechanism of preparatory attention. Here, we demonstrate that
              alpha also plays a role in active target processing. EEG activity
              was recorded from a group of healthy male and female human
              subjects in two visual search experiments. In addition to alpha
              activity, we also assessed the N2pc event-related potential
              component, a lateralized transient EEG response that has been
              tightly linked with the focusing of attention on visual targets.
              We found that the visual search targets triggered both an N2pc
              component and a suppression of alpha-band activity that was
              greatest over the hemisphere contralateral to the target (which
              we call target-elicited lateralized alpha suppression or TELAS).
              In Experiment 1, both N2pc and TELAS were observed for targets
              presented in the lower visual field but were absent for
              upper-field targets. However, these two lateralized effects had
              different time courses, and they responded differently to
              manipulations of crowding in Experiment 2. These results indicate
              that lateralized alpha-band activity is involved in active target
              processing and is not solely a preparatory mechanism, and they
              further indicate that TELAS and N2pc reflect related but
              separable neural mechanism of visuospatial attention.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENTThe very first EEG studies demonstrated that alpha-band
              (8-12 Hz) EEG oscillations are suppressed when people attend to
              visual information, and more recent research has shown that cuing
              an individual to expect a target at a specific location produces
              lateralized suppression in the contralateral hemisphere. Thus,
              lateralized alpha may serve as a preparatory mechanism. In the
              present study, we found that a similar lateralized alpha effect
              is triggered by the appearance of a visual target even though the
              location could not be anticipated, demonstrating that alpha also
              serves as an active mechanism of target processing. Moreover, we
              found that alpha lateralization can be dissociated from other
              lateralized measures of target selection, indicating that it
              reflects a distinct mechanism of attention.",

              the question of how valuation affects cognitive processing has
              received relatively less attention. Here, we review evidence from
              recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies supporting the notion
              that motivation can enhance perceptual and executive control
              processes to achieve more efficient goal-directed behavior.
              Specifically, in the context of cognitive tasks offering monetary
              gains, improved behavioral performance has been repeatedly
              observed in conjunction with elevated neural activations in
              task-relevant perceptual, cognitive and reward-related regions.
              We address the neural basis of motivation-cognition interactions
              by suggesting various modes of communication between relevant
              neural networks: (1) global hub regions may integrate information
              from multiple inputs providing a communicative link between
              specialized networks; (2) point-to-point interactions allow for
              more specific cross-network communication; and (3) diffuse
              neuromodulatory systems can relay motivational signals to cortex
              and enhance signal processing. Together, these modes of

              decisions. In the cognitive sciences, this balance is thought to
              be modulated by a response threshold, the neural substrate of
              which is currently subject to speculation. In a speed
              decision-making experiment, we presented participants with cues

              Application of a mathematical model for the behavioral data
              confirmed that cueing for speed lowered the response threshold.
              Functional neuroimaging showed that cueing for speed activates
              the striatum and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA),
              brain structures that are part of a closed-loop motor circuit

              premature actions. Finally, the data show that individual

               produce transferable training gains, compared with the

  abstract = "Bayesian model selection (BMS) is a powerful method for
              determining the most likely among a set of competing hypotheses
              about the mechanisms that generated observed data. BMS has
              recently found widespread application in neuroimaging,
              particularly in the context of dynamic causal modelling (DCM).
              However, so far, combining BMS results from several subjects has
              relied on simple (fixed effects) metrics, e.g. the group Bayes
              factor (GBF), that do not account for group heterogeneity or
              outliers. In this paper, we compare the GBF with two random
              effects methods for BMS at the between-subject or group level.
              These methods provide inference on model-space using a classical
              and Bayesian perspective respectively. First, a classical
              (frequentist) approach uses the log model evidence as a
              subject-specific summary statistic. This enables one to use
              analysis of variance to test for differences in log-evidences
              over models, relative to inter-subject differences. We then
              consider the same problem in Bayesian terms and describe a novel
              hierarchical model, which is optimised to furnish a probability
              density on the models themselves. This new variational Bayes
              method rests on treating the model as a random variable and
              estimating the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution which
              describes the probabilities for all models considered. These
              probabilities then define a multinomial distribution over model
              space, allowing one to compute how likely it is that a specific
              model generated the data of a randomly chosen subject as well as
              the exceedance probability of one model being more likely than
              any other model. Using empirical and synthetic data, we show that
              optimising a conditional density of the model probabilities,
              given the log-evidences for each model over subjects, is more
              informative and appropriate than both the GBF and frequentist
              tests of the log-evidences. In particular, we found that the
              hierarchical Bayesian approach is considerably more robust than
              either of the other approaches in the presence of outliers. We
              expect that this new random effects method will prove useful for
              a wide range of group studies, not only in the context of DCM,
              but also for other modelling endeavours, e.g. comparing different
              source reconstruction methods for EEG/MEG or selecting among
              competing computational models of learning and decision-making.",

              enhanced if an incentive is provided, the mechanisms enabling
              such motivational control are not known. This study sought to
              uncover how mechanisms of attention and readiness are altered by
              reward-associated incentive stimuli. We measured EEG/ERP activity
              as human adults viewed a high- or low-incentive cue, experienced
              a short preparation interval, and then performed a simple visual
              search task to gain the predicted reward. Search performance was
              faster with high versus low incentives, and this was accompanied
              by distinct incentive-related EEG/ERP patterns at each phase of
              the task (incentive, preparation, and search). First, and most
              surprisingly, attention to high but not low incentive cues was
              actively suppressed, as indexed by a PD component in response to
              the incentive display. During the subsequent preparation
              interval, neural oscillations in the alpha frequency range were
              reduced after high-incentive cues, indicating heightened visual
              readiness. Finally, attentional orienting to the target in the
              search array was deployed with relatively little effort on
              high-incentive trials, as indexed by a reduced N2pc component.
              These results reveal the chain of events by which the brain's

              object recognition and categorization through a massively

              cognition also relies on the ability to perform an arbitrarily
              large set of tasks by flexibly recombining different processors
              into a novel chain. This flexibility comes at the cost of a
              severe slowing down and a seriality of operations (100-500 ms per
              step). A limit on parallel processing is demonstrated in
              experimental setups such as the psychological refractory period
              (PRP) and the attentional blink (AB) in which the processing of
              an element either significantly delays (PRP) or impedes conscious
              access (AB) of a second, rapidly presented element. Here we
              present a spiking-neuron implementation of a cognitive
              architecture where a large number of local parallel processors

              the result of sensory processing on hold, and a slow serial
              performance at the router stage, resulting in a performance

              Similarly, when two successive visual targets are briefly
              flashed, people may fail to detect the second target (Attentional
              Blink or AB). Although AB and PRP are typically studied in very
              different paradigms, a recent detailed neuromimetic model
              suggests that both might arise from the same serial stage during
              which stimuli gain access to consciousness and, as a result, can
              be arbitrarily routed to any other appropriate processor. Here,
              in agreement with this model, we demonstrate that AB and PRP can
              be obtained on alternate trials of the same cross-modal paradigm
              and result from limitations in the same brain mechanisms. We
              asked participants to respond as fast as possible to an auditory
              target T1 and then to a visual target T2 embedded in a series of
              distractors, while brain activity was recorded with
              magneto-encephalography (MEG). For identical stimuli, we observed
              a mixture of blinked trials, where T2 was entirely missed, and
              PRP trials, where T2 processing was delayed. MEG recordings
              showed that PRP and blinked trials underwent identical sensory
              processing in visual occipito-temporal cortices, even including
              the non-conscious separation of targets from distractors.
              However, late activations in frontal cortex (>350 ms), strongly
              influenced by the speed of task-1 execution, were delayed in PRP
              trials and absent in blinked trials. Our findings suggest that
              PRP and AB arise from similar cortical stages, can occur with the
              same exact stimuli, and are merely distinguished by
              trial-by-trial fluctuations in task processing.",

              activity are causally related to decision making. Here we address
              this question by recording and reversibly inactivating the
              lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas of
              rhesus macaques performing a motion direction discrimination
              task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited firing rate patterns that
              directly resembled the evidence accumulation process posited to
              govern decision making, with strong correlations between their
              response fluctuations and the animal's choices. Neurons in area
              MT, in contrast, exhibited weak correlations between their
              response fluctuations and choices, and had firing rate patterns
              consistent with their sensory role in motion encoding. The
              behavioural impact of pharmacological inactivation of each area
              was inversely related to their degree of decision-related
              activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT profoundly impaired
              psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no measurable
              impact on decision-making performance, despite having silenced
              the very clusters that exhibited strong decision-related

              behaviour, it did influence spatial selection and oculomotor

              arguing against several forms of compensation. Thus,
              decision-related signals in LIP do not appear to be critical for
              computing perceptual decisions, and may instead reflect secondary
              processes. Our findings highlight a dissociation between decision
              correlation and causation, showing that strong neuron-decision

              process in which sensory evidence supporting different response

              intraparietal neurons accumulate motion information in favor of a

              discriminated the direction of motion in random-dot visual
              stimuli. The visual task was similar to a motion discrimination
              task that has been used in previous investigations of
              motion-sensitive regions of the extrastriate cortex. The monkeys
              were trained to decide whether the direction of motion was toward
              one of two choice targets that appeared on either side of the
              random-dot stimulus. At the end of the trial, the monkeys
              reported their direction judgment by making an eye movement to
              the appropriate target. We studied neurons in LIP that exhibited
              spatially selective persistent activity during delayed saccadic
              eye movement tasks. These neurons are thought to carry high-level
              signals appropriate for identifying salient visual targets and
              for guiding saccadic eye movements. We arranged the motion
              discrimination task so that one of the choice targets was in the
              LIP neuron's response field (RF) while the other target was
              positioned well away from the RF. During motion viewing, neurons
              in LIP altered their firing rate in a manner that predicted the
              saccadic eye movement that the monkey would make at the end of
              the trial. The activity thus predicted the monkey's judgment of
              motion direction. This predictive activity began early in the
              motion-viewing period and became increasingly reliable as the
              monkey viewed the random-dot motion. The neural activity
              predicted the monkey's direction judgment on both easy and
              difficult trials (strong and weak motion), whether or not the
              judgment was correct. In addition, the timing and magnitude of
              the response was affected by the strength of the motion signal in
              the stimulus. When the direction of motion was toward the RF,
              stronger motion led to larger neural responses earlier in the
              motion-viewing period. When motion was away from the RF, stronger
              motion led to greater suppression of ongoing activity. Thus the
              activity of single neurons in area LIP reflects both the
              direction of an impending gaze shift and the quality of the
              sensory information that instructs such a response. The time
              course of the neural response suggests that LIP accumulates
              sensory signals relevant to the selection of a target for an eye

  abstract = "The basal ganglia (BG) have long been implicated in both motor
              function and dysfunction. It has been proposed that the BG form a
              centralized action selection circuit, resolving conflict between
              multiple neural systems competing for access to the final common
              motor pathway. We present a new spiking neuron model of the BG
              circuitry to test this proposal, incorporating all major features
              and many physiologically plausible details. We include the
              following: effects of dopamine in the subthalamic nucleus (STN)
              and globus pallidus (GP), transmission delays between neurons,
              and specific distributions of synaptic inputs over dendrites. All
              main parameters were derived from experimental studies. We find
              that the BG circuitry supports motor program selection and
              switching, which deteriorates under dopamine-depleted and
              dopamine-excessive conditions in a manner consistent with some
              pathologies associated with those dopamine states. We also
              validated the model against data describing oscillatory
              properties of BG. We find that the same model displayed detailed
              features of both gamma-band (30-80 Hz) and slow (approximately 1
              Hz) oscillatory phenomena reported by Brown et al. (2002) and

              conditions in vivo (but does after combined dopamine depletion

              period (PRP) paradigm, where two tasks have to be performed in
              brief succession, central processing of the second task is
              delayed when the two tasks are performed at short time intervals.
              Here, we aimed to probe the cortical network underlying this
              postponement of central processing by simultaneously recording
              electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance
              imaging (fMRI) data while 12 subjects performed two simple
              number-comparison tasks. Behavioral data showed a significant
              slowing of response times to the second target stimulus at short
              stimulus-onset asynchronies, together with significant
              correlations between response times to the first and second
              target stimulus, i.e., the hallmarks of the PRP effect. The
              analysis of EEG data showed a significant delay of the
              post-perceptual P3 component evoked by the second target, which
              was of similar magnitude as the effect on response times. fMRI
              data revealed an involvement of parietal and prefrontal regions

              restricted injections of neuronal tracers (wheat germ-agglutinin

              cingulate areas (F6, F7, F5, 24c) although present, are
              relatively modest. There is no input from the prefrontal lobe. F3
              is also connected with several postrolandic cortical areas. These
              connections are with areas PC, PE, and PEa in the superior
              parietal lobule, cingulate areas 23 and PEci, the opercular
              parietal areas (PFop, PGop, SII) and the granular insula. F6
              receives a rich input from the anterior premotor areas

              the posterior premotor and cingulate areas is very weak. A strong

              further result was the demonstration of a differential
              connectivity pattern of the cingulate areas 24d and 24c. Area 24d
              is strongly linked with F1 and F3, whereas area 24c is connected

              of parietal cortex is connected with a unique set of frontal
              areas. Thus, area 7m, on the medial parietal surface, is
              interconnected with the dorsal premotor cortex and the
              supplementary motor area, including the supplementary eye field.
              Within the prefrontal cortex, area 7m's connections are with the
              rostral sector of the frontal eye field (FEF), the dorsal bank of
              the principal sulcus, and the anterior bank of the inferior
              arcuate sulcus (Walker's area 45). In contrast, area 7a, on the

              banks of the principal sulcus. Area 7b, in the anterior part of
              the posterior parietal lobule, is interconnected with still a
              different set of frontal areas, which include the ventral
              premotor cortex and supplementary motor area, area 45, and the
              external part of the ventral bank of the principal sulcus. The
              prominent connections of area 7ip, in the posterior bank of the
              intraparietal sulcus, are with the supplementary eye field and
              restricted portions of the ventral premotor cortex, with a wide
              area of the FEF that includes both its rostral and caudal
              sectors, and with area 45. All frontoparietal connections are
              reciprocal, and although they are most prominent within a
              hemisphere, notable interhemispheric connections are also
              present. These findings provide a basis for a parcellation of the

              defined by their specific connections with the posterior parietal

              When subjects engage in a primary task, their ability to respond
              to a second stimulus is degraded. Two competing models of
              multitasking have been proposed: either cognitive resources are
              shared between tasks, or they are allocated to each task
              serially. Using a novel combination of magneto-encephalography
              and multivariate pattern analyses, we obtained a precise
              spatio-temporal decomposition of the brain processes at work
              during multitasking. We discovered that each task relies on a
              sequence of brain processes. These sequences can operate in
              parallel for several hundred milliseconds but beyond ∼ 500 ms,
              they repel each other: processes evoked by the first task are
              shortened, while processes of the second task are either
              lengthened or postponed. These results contradict the
              resource-sharing model and further demonstrate that the serial

              different tasks, a verbal and a motor task, are reviewed in this
              paper. In the first, people practiced a verbal production task,
              generating an appropriate verb in response to a visually
              presented noun. Both practiced and unpracticed conditions
              utilized common regions such as visual and motor cortex. However,
              there was a set of regions that was affected by practice.
              Practice produced a shift in activity from left frontal, anterior
              cingulate, and right cerebellar hemisphere to activity in
              Sylvian-insular cortex. Similar changes were also observed in the
              second task, a task in a very different domain, namely the
              tracing of a maze. Some areas were significantly more activated
              during initial unskilled performance (right premotor and parietal
              cortex and left cerebellar hemisphere); a different region
              (medial frontal cortex, ``supplementary motor area'') showed
              greater activity during skilled performance conditions.
              Activations were also found in regions that most likely control
              movement execution irrespective of skill level (e.g., primary
              motor cortex was related to velocity of movement). One way of
              interpreting these results is in a ``scaffolding-storage''
              framework. For unskilled, effortful performance, a scaffolding
              set of regions is used to cope with novel task demands. Following
              practice, a different set of regions is used, possibly
              representing storage of particular associations or capabilities

              in the basal ganglia have been developed in recent years.
              Prominent in these are actor-critic models of basal ganglia
              functioning, which build on the strong resemblance between
              dopamine neuron activity and the temporal difference prediction
              error signal in the critic, and between dopamine-dependent
              long-term synaptic plasticity in the striatum and learning guided
              by a prediction error signal in the actor. We selectively review
              several actor-critic models of the basal ganglia with an emphasis
              on two important aspects: the way in which models of the critic
              reproduce the temporal dynamics of dopamine firing, and the
              extent to which models of the actor take into account known basal
              ganglia anatomy and physiology. To complement the efforts to
              relate basal ganglia mechanisms to reinforcement learning (RL),
              we introduce an alternative approach to modeling a critic
              network, which uses Evolutionary Computation techniques to
              'evolve' an optimal RL mechanism, and relate the evolved
              mechanism to the basic model of the critic. We conclude our
              discussion of models of the critic by a critical discussion of
              the anatomical plausibility of implementations of a critic in
              basal ganglia circuitry, and conclude that such implementations
              build on assumptions that are inconsistent with the known anatomy
              of the basal ganglia. We return to the actor component of the
              actor-critic model, which is usually modeled at the striatal
              level with very little detail. We describe an alternative model
              of the basal ganglia which takes into account several important,
              and previously neglected, anatomical and physiological
              characteristics of basal ganglia-thalamocortical connectivity and
              suggests that the basal ganglia performs reinforcement-biased
              dimensionality reduction of cortical inputs. We further suggest
              that since such selective encoding may bias the representation at
              the level of the frontal cortex towards the selection of rewarded
              plans and actions, the reinforcement-driven dimensionality
              reduction framework may serve as a basis for basal ganglia actor
              models. We conclude with a short discussion of the dual role of

              that all regions were necessary during the stimulus epoch, but

              our ability to nimbly shift between task sets remain poorly
              understood. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
              studies employing multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) have shown
              that a currently relevant task set can be decoded from activity
              patterns in the frontoparietal cortex, but whether these regions
              support the dynamic transformation of task sets from trial to
              trial is not clear. Here, we combined a cued task-switching
              protocol with human (both sexes) fMRI, and harnessed
              representational similarity analysis (RSA) to facilitate a novel
              assessment of trial-by-trial changes in neural task-set
              representations. We first used MVPA to define task-sensitive
              frontoparietal and visual regions and found that neural task-set
              representations on switch trials are less stably encoded than on
              repeat trials. We then exploited RSA to show that the neural
              representational pattern dissimilarity across consecutive trials
              is greater for switch trials than for repeat trials, and that the
              degree of this pattern dissimilarity predicts behavior. Moreover,
              the overall neural pattern of representational dissimilarities
              followed from the assumption that repeating sets, compared with
              switching sets, results in stronger neural task representations.
              Finally, when moving from cue to target phase within a trial,
              pattern dissimilarities tracked the transformation from
              previous-trial task representations to the currently relevant
              set. These results provide neural evidence for the longstanding
              assumptions of an effortful task-set reconfiguration process
              hampered by task-set inertia, and they demonstrate that
              frontoparietal and stimulus processing regions support ``dynamic
              adaptive coding,'' flexibly representing changing task sets in a
              trial-by-trial fashion.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Humans can fluently
              switch between different tasks, reflecting an ability to
              dynamically configure ``task sets,'' rule representations that
              link stimuli to appropriate responses. Recent studies show that
              neural signals in frontal and parietal brain regions can tell us
              which of two tasks a person is currently performing. However, it
              is not known whether these regions are also involved in
              dynamically reconfiguring task-set representations when switching
              between tasks. Here we measured human brain activity during task
              switching and tracked the similarity of neural task-set
              representations from trial to trial. We show that frontal and
              parietal brain regions flexibly recode changing task sets in a

              problem state, or intermediate mental representation, at a time.
              When more than one problem state is required, for example in
              multitasking, performance decreases considerably. This effect has
              been explained in terms of a problem state bottleneck.
              METHODOLOGY: In the current study we use the complimentary
              methodologies of computational cognitive modeling and
              neuroimaging to investigate the neural correlates of this problem
              state bottleneck. In particular, an existing computational
              cognitive model was used to generate a priori fMRI predictions
              for a multitasking experiment in which the problem state
              bottleneck plays a major role. Hemodynamic responses were
              predicted for five brain regions, corresponding to five cognitive
              resources in the model. Most importantly, we predicted the
              intraparietal sulcus to show a strong effect of the problem state
              manipulations. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the predictions were
              confirmed by a subsequent fMRI experiment, while others were not
              matched by the data. The experiment supported the hypothesis that
              the problem state bottleneck is a plausible cause of the

              selection may be recast in terms of signal selection. The generic
              properties of signal selection are defined and neural networks
              for this type of computation examined. A comparison between these
              networks and basal ganglia anatomy leads to a novel functional
              decomposition of the basal ganglia architecture into 'selection'
              and 'control' pathways. The former pathway performs the selection
              per se via a feedforward off-centre on-surround network. The
              control pathway regulates the action of the selection pathway to
              ensure its effective operation, and synergistically complements
              its dopaminergic modulation. The model contrasts with the
              prevailing functional segregation of basal ganglia into 'direct'
              and 'indirect' pathways.",

              Independent evidence from each of these fields has reinforced a
              growing perception that the functional architecture of the basal
              ganglia is essentially parallel in nature, regardless of the

              ganglia organization, which generally emphasized the serial
              aspects of their connectivity. Current evidence suggests that the
              basal ganglia are organized into several structurally and
              functionally distinct 'circuits' that link cortex, basal ganglia

              Recently, the patterns of anatomical connections using diffusion
              tensor imaging (DTI) have been used to parcellate brain regions.
              Here, we present a noninvasive parcellation approach that uses
              ``functional fingerprints'' obtained by correlation measures on
              resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data
              to parcellate brain regions. In other terms, brain regions are
              parcellated based on the similarity of their connection--as
              reflected by correlation during resting state--to the whole
              brain. The proposed method was used to parcellate the medial
              frontal cortex (MFC) into supplementary motor areas (SMA) and
              pre-SMA subregions. In agreement with anatomical landmark-based
              parcellation, we find that functional fingerprint clustering of
              the MFC results in anterior and posterior clusters. The
              probabilistic maps from 12 subjects showed that the anterior
              cluster is mainly located rostral to the vertical commissure
              anterior (VCA) line, whereas the posterior cluster is mainly
              located caudal to VCA line, suggesting the homologues of pre-SMA
              and SMA. The functional connections from the putative pre-SMA
              cluster were connected to brain regions which are responsible for
              complex/cognitive motor control, whereas those from the putative
              SMA cluster were connected to brain regions which are related to
              the simple motor control. These findings demonstrate the

              that impair dual-task performance at the beginning of practice
              are associated with mechanisms for the reduction of dual-task
              impairment at the end of practice. The following types of
              processes provide sources for the occurrence of this impairment:
              (a) capacity-limited processes within the component tasks, such
              as response-selection or motor response stages, and (b) cognitive
              control processes independent of these tasks and thus operating

              show that, under very specific conditions, capacity-limited
              processes within the component tasks are automatized with
              practice, reducing the interference between two simultaneous

              stages are sources for dual-task costs at the beginning of
              practice and are overcome with practice. However, there is no
              evidence demonstrating the existence of practice-related
              mechanisms associated with capacity-limited motor-response
              stages. Further, during practice, there is an acquisition of

              stimulus probabilities. This online inference, modeled using a
              hierarchical Bayesian learner, was reflected behaviorally: speed
              and accuracy of motor responses increased significantly with

              ``automatic'' stages proceed unhindered. A prediction was derived

              condition the effect of second task factors that slow automatic
              stages should be reduced, whereas the effect of factors slowing
              later nonautomatic stages should be unchanged. The data

               efficiently is a much-desired cognitive skill, but one that
               remains elusive due to the brain's inherent
               information-processing limitations. Multitasking performance
               can, however, be greatly improved through cognitive training
               (Van Selst et al., 1999, Dux et al., 2009). Previous studies
               have examined how patterns of brain activity change following
               training (for review, see Kelly and Garavan, 2005). Here, in a
               large-scale human behavioral and imaging study of 100 healthy
               adults, we tested whether multitasking training benefits,
               assessed using a standard dual-task paradigm, are associated
               with variability in brain structure. We found that the volume of
               the rostral part of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
               (DLPFC) predicted an individual's response to training.
               Critically, this association was observed exclusively in a
               task-specific training group, and not in an active-training
               control group. Our findings reveal a link between DLPFC
               structure and an individual's propensity to gain from training
               on a task that taps the limits of cognitive control.
               SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cognitive ``brain'' training is a
               rapidly growing, multibillion dollar industry (Hayden, 2012)
               that has been touted as the panacea for a variety of disorders
               that result in cognitive decline. A key process targeted by such
               training is ``cognitive control.'' Here, we combined an
               established cognitive control measure, multitasking ability,
               with structural brain imaging in a sample of 100 participants.
               Our goal was to determine whether individual differences in
               brain structure predict the extent to which people derive
               measurable benefits from a cognitive training regime. Ours is
               the first study to identify a structural brain marker-volume of

              Using measures of behavior and brain electricity in male and

              towards a common response threshold. Activity in the accumulators

              the degree to which spatial attention can be divided across
              spatially noncontiguous objects has long been debated,
              particularly when those objects are in close proximity. Moreover,
              the temporal dynamics of divided attention are unclear: is the
              process of dividing spatial attention gradual and continuous, or
              does it onset in a discrete manner? To address these issues, we
              recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) as
              subjects covertly monitored two flickering targets while ignoring
              an intervening distractor that flickered at a different
              frequency. All three stimuli were clustered within either the
              lower left or the lower right quadrant, and our dependent measure
              was SSVEP power at the target and distractor frequencies measured
              over time. In two experiments, we observed a temporally discrete
              increase in power for target- vs. distractor-evoked SSVEPs
              extending from ∼350 to 150 ms prior to correct (but not
              incorrect) responses. The divergence in SSVEP power immediately
              prior to a correct response suggests that spatial attention can
              be divided across noncontiguous locations, even when the targets
              are closely spaced within a single quadrant. In addition, the

              often but are not better distinguished from noise. However,
              conventional analyses that estimate sensitivity and bias by
              comparing true- and false-positive rates offer limited insights
              into the mechanisms responsible for these effects. Here, we
              reassessed the prior influences of signal probability and

              reverse-correlation technique that quantifies how signal-like

  abstract = "The brain exhibits organized fluctuations of neural activity,
              even in the absence of tasks or sensory input. A prominent type
              of such spontaneous activity is the alpha rhythm, which
              influences perception and interacts with other ongoing neural
              activity. It is currently hypothesized that states of decreased
              prestimulus $\alpha$ oscillations indicate enhanced neural
              excitability, resulting in improved perceptual acuity.
              Nevertheless, it remains debated how changes in excitability
              manifest at the behavioral level in perceptual tasks. We
              addressed this issue by comparing two alternative models
              describing the effect of spontaneous $\alpha$ power on signal
              detection. The first model assumes that decreased $\alpha$ power
              increases baseline excitability, amplifying the response to both
              signal and noise, predicting a liberal detection criterion with
              no effect on sensitivity. The second model predicts that
              decreased $\alpha$ power increases the trial-by-trial precision
              of the sensory response, resulting in improved sensitivity. We
              tested these models in two EEG experiments in humans where we
              analyzed the effects of prestimulus $\alpha$ power on visual
              detection and discrimination using a signal detection framework.
              Both experiments provide strong evidence that decreased $\alpha$
              power reflects a more liberal detection criterion, rather than
              improved sensitivity, consistent with the baseline model. In
              other words, when the task requires detecting stimulus presence
              versus absence, reduced $\alpha$ oscillations make observers more
              likely to report the stimulus regardless of actual stimulus
              presence. Contrary to previous interpretations, these results
              suggest that states of decreased $\alpha$ oscillations increase
              the global baseline excitability of sensory systems without
              affecting perceptual acuity. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Spontaneous
              fluctuations of brain activity explain why a faint sensory
              stimulus is sometimes perceived and sometimes not. The prevailing
              view is that heightened neural excitability, indexed by decreased
              $\alpha$ oscillations, promotes better perceptual performance.
              Here, we provide evidence that heightened neural excitability
              instead reflects a state of biased perception, during which a
              person is more likely to see a stimulus, whether or not it is
              actually present. Therefore, we propose that changes in neural
              excitability leave the precision of sensory processing
              unaffected. These results establish the link between spontaneous
              brain activity and the variability in human perception.",

              distinguished these responses as reflected in the first and
              second harmonics in the steady-state visual evoked potentials.
              These harmonics revealed the spatial and functional segregation
              of frequency-following (the first harmonic) and
              frequency-doubling (the second harmonic) neural populations.
              Spatially, the first and second harmonics in steady-state visual
              evoked potentials exhibited divergent posterior scalp
              topographies for a broad range of EEG frequencies. The scalp

              derived from single-trial EEG variability were used as contextual
              modulators on fMRI-derived estimates of effective connectivity
              between key regions of the face perception network. The overall
              construction of our model space was highly constrained by the
              effects of task and ERP parameters on our fMRI data. Bayesian
              model selection suggested that the occipital face area (OFA)
              acted as a central gatekeeper directing visual information to the
              superior temporal sulcus (STS), the fusiform face area (FFA), and
              to a medial region of the fusiform gyrus (mFG). The connection
              from the OFA to the STS was strengthened on trials in which N170
              amplitudes to upright faces were large. In contrast, the
              connection from the OFA to the mFG, an area known to be involved
              in object processing, was enhanced for inverted faces
              particularly on trials in which N170 amplitudes were small. Our
              results suggest that trial-by-trial variation in neural activity
              at around 170 ms, reflected in the N170 component, reflects the
              relative engagement of the OFA to STS/FFA network over the OFA to
              mFG object processing network for face perception. Importantly,
              the DCMs predicted the observed data significantly better by
              including the modulators derived from the N170, highlighting the
              value of incorporating EEG-derived information to explain
              interactions between regions as a multi-modal data fusion method
              for combined EEG-fMRI.",

  abstract = "Rhythmic brain activity is thought to reflect, and to help
              organize, spike activity in populations of neurons during
              on-going behavior. We report that during learning, a major
              transition occurs in task-related oscillatory activity in the
              ventromedial striatum, a striatal region related to
              motivation-dependent learning. Early on as rats learned a T-maze
              task, bursts of 70- to 90-Hz high-$\gamma$ activity were
              prominent during T-maze runs, but these gradually receded as
              bursts of 15- to 28-Hz $\beta$-band activity became pronounced.
              Populations of simultaneously recorded neurons synchronized their
              spike firing similarly during both the high-$\gamma$-band and
              $\beta$-band bursts. Thus, the structure of spike firing was
              reorganized during learning in relation to different rhythms.
              Spiking was concentrated around the troughs of the
              $\beta$-oscillations for fast-spiking interneurons and around the
              peaks for projection neurons, indicating alternating periods of
              firing at different frequencies as learning progressed.
              Spike-field synchrony was primarily local during
              high-$\gamma$-bursts but was widespread during $\beta$-bursts.
              The learning-related shift in the probability of high-$\gamma$
              and $\beta$-bursting thus could reflect a transition from a
              mainly focal rhythmic inhibition during early phases of learning
              to a more distributed mode of rhythmic inhibition as learning
              continues and behavior becomes habitual. These dynamics could
              underlie changing functions of the ventromedial striatum during
              habit formation. More generally, our findings suggest that
              coordinated changes in the spatiotemporal relationships of local
              field potential oscillations and spike activity could be
              hallmarks of the learning process.",

              shifts to either a left or right peripheral position in the

              modulations of oscillatory alpha-band (8-14 Hz) activity over
              left versus right posterior sites. These changes were driven by
              varying degrees of alpha-decreases being maximal contralateral to
              the attended position. When expressed as a lateralization index,
              these alpha-changes differed significantly between attention
              conditions, with negative values (alpha\_right < alpha\_left)
              indexing leftward and more positive values (alpha\_left < or =

              appeared deterministic for processing of forthcoming visual

              target processing in accordance with an overall negative bias in
              alpha-index values. Across trials, left targets were detected
              most rapidly when preceded by negative index values. Detection of
              right targets was fastest in trials with most positive values.
              Our data indicate that collateral modulations of posterior
              alpha-activity, the momentary bias of visuospatial attention, and
              imminent visual processing are linked. They suggest that the
              momentary direction of attention, predicting spatial biases in

              consecutive PD patients who were not receiving levodopa or
              dopamine agonists (disease duration < or = 10 years). We
              investigated the influence of gender and oestrogen status on: (1)
              age at onset, (2) presenting symptom, (3) severity and
              progression of motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating

              nigrostriatal degeneration ([123I]FP-CIT single photon emission
              computed tomography measurements). RESULTS: Age at onset was 2.1
              years later in women (53.4 years) than in men (51.3 years). In
              women, age at onset correlated positively with parity, age at

              Women had a 16\% higher striatal [123I]FP-CIT binding than men at

              thought that early or exogenous components reflect a perturbation
              of neuronal dynamics by sensory input bottom-up processing.
              Conversely, later, endogenous components have been ascribed to
              recurrent dynamics among hierarchically disposed cortical

              mediated by backward connections. This evidence is furnished by

              important constraints on effective connectivity, but does not
              fully determine it, because synaptic connections can be expressed
              functionally in a dynamic and context-dependent fashion. Although
              it is generally assumed that anatomical connectivity data is
              important to guide the construction of neurobiologically

              constructed 64 alternative DCMs, which embodied different

              orienting in an evolutionarily older species, the archer fish,
              which lacks neocortex-like cells. We used Posner's classic
              endogenous cuing task, in which a centrally presented, spatially
              informative cue is followed by a target. The fish responded to
              the target by shooting a stream of water at it. Interestingly,
              the fish demonstrated a human-like ``volitional'' facilitation
              effect: their reaction times to targets that appeared on the side
              indicated by the precue were faster than their reaction times to
              targets on the opposite side. The fish also exhibited inhibition
              of return, an aftermath of orienting that commonly emerges only
              in reflexive orienting tasks in human participants. We believe
              that this pattern demonstrates the acquisition of an arbitrary
              connection between spatial orienting and a nonspatial feature of
              a centrally presented stimulus in nonprimate species. In the

               ('nigrosomes') defined by analysis of the three-dimensional
               networks formed by the calbindin-poor zones. These zones were
               recognizable in all of the brains, despite severe loss of
               dopamine-containing neurons. The degree of loss of
               dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars
               compacta was related to the duration of the disease, and the
               cell loss followed a strict order. The degree of neuronal loss
               was significantly higher in the nigrosomes than in the matrix.
               Depletion was maximum (98\%) in the main pocket (nigrosome 1),
               located in the caudal and mediolateral part of the substantia
               nigra pars compacta. Progressively less cell loss was detectable
               in more medial and more rostral nigrosomes, following the

               substantia nigra pars compacta for each Parkinson's disease
               patient: depletion begins in the main pocket (nigrosome 1) and

              Rodent STN lesions or inactivation are linked with perseveration

              compulsivity (goal-directed and habit learning, perseveration,
              and self-reported obsessive - compulsive symptoms) and the

  abstract = "This article focuses on the interaction between the basal ganglia
              (BG) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The BG are a group of nuclei at
              the base of the forebrain that are highly connected with cortex.
              A century of research suggests that the role of the BG is not
              exclusively motor, and that the BG also play an important role in
              learning and memory. In this review article, we argue that one
              important role of the BG is to train connections between
              posterior cortical areas and frontal cortical regions that are
              responsible for automatic behavior after extensive training.
              According to this view, one effect of BG trial-and-error learning
              is to activate the correct frontal areas shortly after posterior
              associative cortex activation, thus allowing for Hebbian learning
              of robust, fast, and efficient cortico-cortical processing. This
              hypothesized process is general, and the content of the learned
              associations depends on the specific areas involved (e.g.,
              associations involving premotor areas would be more closely
              related to behavior than associations involving the PFC). We
              review experiments aimed at pinpointing the function of the BG
              and the frontal cortex and show that these results are consistent
              with the view that the BG is a general purpose trainer for
              cortico-cortical connections. We conclude with a discussion of
              some implications of the integrative framework and how this can
              help better understand the role of the BG in many different

               functions in anxiety of the septo-hippocampal system and the
               amygdala are extensively analysed, as are their separate roles
               in memory and fear. Their functions are related to a hierarchy

               behaviour. The resulting theory is applied to the typology,

               the symptoms of amnesia. Available for the first time in

              outcomes of these decisions have different likelihoods of
              occurrence, the decision-maker must consider both the magnitude
              of each outcome and the probability of its occurrence, but how do
              individual decision makers combine the two dimensions of
              magnitude and probability? Here, we approach the problem by
              separating in time the presentation of magnitude and probability
              information, and focus the analysis of fMRI activations on the
              first piece of information only. Thus, we are able to identify
              distinct neural circuits for the two dimensions without the
              confounding effect of divided attention or the cognitive
              operation of combining them. We find that magnitude information
              correlates with the size of the response of the ventral striatum

              dorsal striatum. The relative responsiveness of these two

              weight one more than the other. The results are consistent with a

              next. The physiological study of regularity extraction has
              focused primarily on repetitive sequence-based rules within the

              context of reward-based decision-making. Here we ask whether we
              implicitly encode non-sequential stochastic regularities, and
              detect violations therein. We addressed this question using a
              novel experimental design and both behavioural and
              magnetoencephalographic (MEG) metrics associated with responses
              to pure-tone sounds with frequencies sampled from a Gaussian

              distribution evoked a larger response than those that fell at the
              centre. This response resembled the mismatch negativity (MMN)
              evoked by surprising or unlikely events in traditional oddball

              related to predictive coding. In this scheme, (generalised)
              states of the world are represented as trajectories. When these
              states include motor trajectories they implicitly entail
              intentions (future motor states). Optimizing the representation

              that of cortical frontoparietal networks [1-3]. Studies of visual

              geniculate nucleus in visuospatial perception and attention
              [4-10] and for mediodorsal thalamus in oculomotor control [11].
              Ventrolateral thalamus contains subdivisions devoted to action
              control as part of a circuit involving the basal ganglia [12, 13]
              and motor, premotor, and prefrontal cortices [14], whereas
              anterior thalamus forms a memory network in connection with the
              hippocampus [15]. This connectivity profile suggests that
              ventrolateral and anterior thalamus may represent a nexus between
              mnemonic and control functions, such as action or attentional
              selection. Here, we characterize the role of thalamus in the
              interplay between memory and visual attention. We show that
              ventrolateral lesions impair the influence of WM representations

              contents. To further characterize the memory types used by the
              thalamus to bias attention, we performed a second fMRI study that
              involved learning of stimulus-stimulus associations and their
              retrieval from long-term memory to optimize attention in search.
              Responses in ventrolateral and anterior thalamic nuclei tracked

              by inhibiting task-irrelevant regions, thus routing information
              to task-relevant regions. The functional inhibition is reflected
              in oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). From a
              physiological perspective the alpha activity provides pulsed
              inhibition reducing the processing capabilities of a given area.
              Active processing in the engaged areas is reflected by neuronal
              synchronization in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) accompanied by an

  abstract = "The brain is limited in its capacity to consciously process
              information, necessitating gating of information. While conscious
              perception is robustly associated with sustained, recurrent
              interactions between widespread cortical regions, subcortical
              regions, including the striatum, influence cortical activity.
              Here, we examined whether the ventral striatum, given its ability
              to modulate cortical information flow, contributes to conscious
              perception. Using intracranial EEG, we recorded ventral striatum
              activity while 7 patients performed an attentional blink task in
              which they had to detect two targets (T1 and T2) in a stream of
              distractors. Typically, when T2 follows T1 within 100-500 ms, it
              is often not perceived (i.e., the attentional blink). We found
              that conscious T2 perception was influenced and signaled by
              ventral striatal activity. Specifically, the failure to perceive
              T2 was foreshadowed by a T1-induced increase in $\alpha$ and low
              $\beta$ oscillatory activity as early as 80 ms after T1,
              indicating that the attentional blink to T2 may be due to very
              early T1-driven attentional capture. Moreover, only consciously
              perceived targets were associated with an increase in $\vartheta$
              activity between 200 and 400 ms. These unique findings shed new
              light on the mechanisms that give rise to the attentional blink
              by revealing that conscious target perception may be determined
              by T1 processing at a much earlier processing stage than
              traditionally believed. More generally, they indicate that
              ventral striatum activity may contribute to conscious perception,
              presumably by gating cortical information flow. SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT: What determines whether we become aware of a piece of
              information or not? Conscious access has been robustly associated
              with activity within a distributed network of cortical regions.
              Using intracranial electrophysiological recordings during an
              attentional blink task, we tested the idea that the ventral
              striatum, because of its ability to modulate cortical information
              flow, may contribute to conscious perception. We find that
              conscious perception is influenced and signaled by ventral
              striatal activity. Short-latency (80-140 ms) striatal responses
              to a first target determined conscious perception of a second
              target. Moreover, conscious perception of the second target was
              signaled by longer-latency (200-400 ms) striatal activity. These
              results suggest that the ventral striatum may be part of a
              subcortical network that influences conscious experience.",

              received and predicted rewards. They are crucial for basic forms
              of learning about rewards and make us strive for more rewards-an
              evolutionary beneficial trait. Most dopamine neurons in the
              midbrain of humans, monkeys, and rodents signal a reward
              prediction error; they are activated by more reward than
              predicted (positive prediction error), remain at baseline
              activity for fully predicted rewards, and show depressed activity
              with less reward than predicted (negative prediction error). The
              dopamine signal increases nonlinearly with reward value and codes

              amplify the dopamine reward signal and induce exaggerated,

              based on timing interact by manipulating the task relevance and a
              priori probability of auditory stimulus onset timing within a
              go/no-go task while recording EEG. Preparatory activity, as

              depends on the pre-target phase of an ∼8 Hz brain rhythm. When
              multiple locations are monitored, performance decrements suggest
              a division of the 8 Hz rhythm over the number of locations,
              indicating that different locations are sequentially sampled.
              Indeed, when subjects monitor two locations, performance benefits
              alternate at a 4 Hz rhythm. These performance alternations were
              revealed after a reset of attention to one location. Although
              resets are common and important events for attention, it is
              unknown whether, in the absence of resets, ongoing attention
              samples stimuli in alternation. Here, we examined whether
              spatially specific attentional sampling can be revealed by
              ongoing pre-target brain rhythms. Visually induced gamma-band
              activity plays a role in spatial attention. Therefore, we
              hypothesized that performance on two simultaneously monitored
              stimuli can be predicted by a 4 Hz modulation of gamma-band
              activity. Brain rhythms were assessed with magnetoencephalography

              spatially selective, target-related fluctuations. The resulting
              lateralized gamma-band activity (LGA) showed opposite pre-target
              4 Hz phases for detected versus missed targets. The 4 Hz phase of
              pre-target LGA accounted for a 14.5\% modulation in performance.
              These findings suggest that spatial attention is a theta-rhythmic

               models by saying that Ss switch in analyzers as well as learning
               stimulus-response associations. It is argued that this

               ignore relevant and irrelevant stimuli (i.e., that a may
               increase or decrease depending on the correlation of a stimulus

              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We take advantage of different
              training regimens found to produce qualitatively different types
              of perceptual expertise behaviorally in order to contrast the
              neural changes that follow different kinds of visual experience
              with the same objects. Two groups of participants went through
              training regimens that required either subordinate-level
              individuation or basic-level categorization of a set of novel,
              artificial objects, called ``Ziggerins''. fMRI activity of a
              region in the right fusiform gyrus increased after individuation
              training and was correlated with the magnitude of configural
              processing of the Ziggerins observed behaviorally. In contrast,
              categorization training caused distributed changes, with
              increased activity in the medial portion of the ventral

              CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that the kind

              influence how those objects are represented in visual cortex. The

              tasks; however, this question has not been investigated
              systematically in the context of perceptual tasks. The goal of
              this study was to gain insight into the decision-making strategy
              used by human observers in a low-level perceptual task. Data from
              more than 100 individuals who participated in an auditory-visual
              spatial localization task was evaluated to examine which of three
              plausible strategies could account for each observer's behavior
              the best. This task is very suitable for exploring this question
              because it involves an implicit inference about whether the
              auditory and visual stimuli were caused by the same object or
              independent objects, and provides different strategies of how
              using the inference about causes can lead to distinctly different
              spatial estimates and response patterns. For example, employing
              the commonly used cost function of minimizing the mean squared
              error of spatial estimates would result in a weighted averaging
              of estimates corresponding to different causal structures. A
              strategy that would minimize the error in the inferred causal
              structure would result in the selection of the most likely causal
              structure and sticking with it in the subsequent inference of
              location-``model selection.'' A third strategy is one that
              selects a causal structure in proportion to its probability, thus
              attempting to match the probability of the inferred causal
              structure. This type of probability matching strategy has been
              reported to be used by participants predominantly in cognitive
              tasks. Comparing these three strategies, the behavior of the vast
              majority of observers in this perceptual task was most consistent
              with probability matching. While this appears to be a suboptimal
              strategy and hence a surprising choice for the perceptual system
              to adopt, we discuss potential advantages of such a strategy for
              perception.",

               developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of
               a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the
               Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis
               when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although
               there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in
               the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been
               given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In
               this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in
               the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports,
               ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following
               points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of
               hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a
               scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating
               evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a
               way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of
               evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and
               do not require alternative models to be nested. Several
               techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including
               asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the
               output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In
               ``non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or
               BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes
               factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of
               prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or
               prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be
               attached to various models so that a composite estimate or
               prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or
               model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow
               model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of
               models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are
               useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is

              the processes underlying this effect? To address these questions,
              we used a spatial cueing paradigm to measure the relationship
              between cue predictability (measured in bits of information) and
              the voluntary attention effect, the benefit in reaction time (RT)

              the cognitive processes producing this effect, we used a simple
              RT model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model. We found that

              salience or is contingent on attentional control settings induced
              by task demands. The authors addressed this issue using the
              N2-posterior- contralateral (N2pc) effect, a component of the
              event-related brain potential thought to reflect attentional
              allocation. They presented a cue display followed by a target
              display of 4 letters. Each display contained a green item and a
              red item. Some participants responded to the red letter and
              others to the green letter. Converging lines of evidence
              indicated that attention was captured by the cues with the same
              color as the target. First, these target-color cues produced a
              cuing validity effect on behavioral measures. Second, distractors
              appearing in the cued location produced larger compatibility
              effects. Third, the target-color cue produced a robust N2pc
              effect, similar in magnitude to the N2pc effect to the target
              itself. Furthermore, the target-color cue elicited a similar N2pc
              effect regardless of whether it competed with a simultaneous
              abrupt onset. The findings provide converging evidence for

              where the N2pc component was measured as an electrophysiological
              marker of attentional selection in response to spatially
              uninformative color singleton cues that preceded target arrays.
              When observers had to report the orientation of a uniquely

              spatial cueing effects were accompanied by an early cue-induced

  abstract = "Predicting future reward is paramount to performing an optimal
              action. Although a number of brain areas are known to encode such
              predictions, a detailed account of how the associated
              representations evolve over time is lacking. Here, we address
              this question using human magnetoencephalography (MEG) and
              multivariate analyses of instantaneous activity in reconstructed
              sources. We overtrained participants on a simple instrumental
              reward learning task where geometric cues predicted a
              distribution of possible rewards, from which a sample was
              revealed 2000 ms later. We show that predicted mean reward (i.e.,
              expected value), and predicted reward variability (i.e., economic
              risk), are encoded distinctly. Early on, representations of mean
              reward are seen in parietal and visual areas, and later in
              frontal regions with orbitofrontal cortex emerging last.
              Strikingly, an encoding of reward variability emerges
              simultaneously in parietal/sensory and frontal sources and later
              than mean reward encoding. An orbitofrontal variability encoding
              emerged around the same time as that seen for mean reward.
              Crucially, cross-prediction showed that mean reward and
              variability representations are distinct and also revealed that
              instantaneous representations become more stable over time.
              Across sources, the best fitting metric for variability signals
              was coefficient of variation (rather than SD or variance), but
              distinct best metrics were seen for individual brain regions. Our
              data demonstrate how a dynamic encoding of probabilistic reward
              prediction unfolds in the brain both in time and
              space.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Predicting future reward is
              paramount to optimal behavior. To gain insight into the
              underlying neural computations, we investigate how reward
              representations in the brain arise over time. Using
              magnetoencephalography, we show that a representation of
              predicted mean reward emerges early in parietal/sensory regions
              and later in frontal cortex. In contrast, predicted reward
              variability representations appear in most regions at the same
              time, and slightly later than for mean reward. For both features,
              representations dynamically change >1000 ms before stabilizing.
              The best metric for encoding variability is coefficient of
              variation, with heterogeneity in this encoding seen between brain
              areas. The results provide novel insights into the emergence of
              predictive reward representations.",

  abstract = "Choosing the option with the highest expected value (EV; reward
              probability $\times$ reward magnitude) maximizes the intake of
              reward under conditions of uncertainty. However, human economic
              choices indicate that our value calculation has a subjective
              component whereby probability and reward magnitude are not
              linearly weighted. Using a similar economic framework, our goal
              was to characterize how subjective value influences the
              generation of simple motor actions. Specifically, we hypothesized
              that attributes of saccadic eye movements could provide insight
              into how rhesus monkeys, a well-studied animal model in cognitive
              neuroscience, subjectively value potential visual targets. In the
              first experiment, monkeys were free to choose by directing a
              saccade toward one of two simultaneously displayed targets, each
              of which had an uncertain outcome. In this task, choices were
              more likely to be allocated toward the higher valued target. In
              the second experiment, only one of the two possible targets
              appeared on each trial. In this task, saccadic reaction times
              (SRTs) decreased toward the higher valued target. Reward
              magnitude had a much stronger influence on both choices and SRTs
              than probability, whose effect was observed only when reward
              magnitude was similar for both targets. Across EV blocks, a
              strong relationship was observed between choice preferences and
              SRTs. However, choices tended to maximize at skewed values
              whereas SRTs varied more continuously. Lastly, SRTs were
              unchanged when all reward magnitudes were 1$\times$, 1.5$\times$,
              and 2$\times$ their normal amount, indicating that saccade
              preparation was influenced by the relative value of the targets
              rather than the absolute value of any single-target. We conclude
              that value is not only an important factor( )for deliberative
              decision making in primates, but also for the selection and
              preparation of simple motor actions, such as saccadic eye
              movements. More precisely, our results indicate that, under
              conditions of uncertainty, saccade choices and reaction times are

              searched for a shape singleton in a testing phase. Experiment 1
              found that participants were slower in the testing phase if a
              distractor of a previous target color was present rather than
              absent. Such slowing was observed even when no monetary reward
              was used during training. Experiment 2 associated monetary
              rewards with the target colors during the training phase.
              Participants were faster finding the target associated with
              higher monetary reward. However, reward training did not yield
              value-dependent attentional capture in the testing phase.
              Attentional capture by the previous target colors was not
              significantly greater for the previously high-reward color than
              the previously low or no-reward color. These findings revealed
              both the power and limitations of monetary reward on attention.
              Although monetary reward can increase attentional priority for
              the high-reward target during training, subsequent attentional
              capture effects may not be reward-based, but reflect, in part,
              attentional capture by previous targets.",

              interact to modulate visual selection; the other predicts that
              visual selection is determined by the independent combination of
              relevant and irrelevant feature effects. These alternatives were
              tested using a visual search task that contained multiple
              targets, placing a high demand on the need for selectivity, and
              that was data-limited and required unspeeded responses,
              emphasizing early perceptual selection processes. One week prior
              to the visual search task, participants completed a training task
              in which they learned to associate particular colors with a
              specific reward value. In the search task, the reward-associated
              colors were presented surrounding targets and distractors, but
              were neither physically salient nor task-relevant. In two
              experiments, the irrelevant reward-associated features influenced
              performance, but only when they were presented in a task-relevant
              location. The costs induced by the irrelevant reward-associated
              features were greater when they oriented attention to a target

              spatial attention to one visual quadrant by (i) instructing
              people to prioritize it (goal-driven attention), (ii) placing the

              associating that quadrant with greater monetary gain

              goal-driven attention exerted the strongest influence on search
              RT. Incidental location probability learning yielded a smaller
              though still robust effect. Incidental reward learning produced
              negligible guidance for spatial attention. The 95 \% confidence
              intervals of the three effects were largely nonoverlapping. To
              understand these results, we simulated the role of location
              repetition priming in probability cuing and reward learning.
              Repetition priming underestimated the strength of location

              long-term statistical learning of how to shift attention.
              Repetition priming provided a reasonable account for the

              whether a stimulus captures attention is not determined solely by
              its physical properties, but is malleable, being influenced by
              our previous experience of rewards obtained by attending to that

              distractor stimuli led to a reduction in the reward obtained.
              Nevertheless, distractors signaling large reward produced greater
              attentional and oculomotor capture than those signaling small

              one of two major theoretical frameworks: ``choice probability''
              or ``subjective value.'' These two formulations represent
              behavioral quantities closely tied to the decision process, but
              it is unknown whether one of these variables, or both, dominates
              the neural mechanisms that mediate choice. Value and choice
              probability are difficult to distinguish in practice, because
              higher-valued options are chosen more frequently in free-choice
              tasks. This distinction is particularly relevant for sensorimotor
              areas such as parietal cortex, where both value information and
              motor signals related to choice have been observed. We recorded
              the activity of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area while
              monkeys performed an intertemporal choice task for rewards

              individual-specific discounted value of delayed rewards, with
              peak subjective value modulation occurring early in task trials.
              In contrast, late in the decision process these same neurons

              the strong delay-related modulation early during decision making
              is driven by subjective value rather than the monkey's

              closer inspection. Primarily, the tasks aiming to produce covert
              or overt shifts of attention were not always comparable.
              Secondly, the previous studies disagreed on whether greater
              neural activity is elicited by covert shifts or overt shifts of
              attention. Thirdly, the previous studies differed on whether the

              Finally, the statistical analyses used by all previous studies
              failed to account for between subject variability. The present
              study was designed to address all these issues. Twelve healthy

              movements) as well as for overt shifts of spatial attention
              (shifts of attention with saccadic eye movements). Studies
              examining activity in this visuospatial network during
              attentional shifts at a single rate have given conflicting
              reports about how the activity differs for overt and covert
              shifts. To better understand how the network subserves
              attentional shifts, we performed a parametric study in which
              subjects made either overt attentional shifts or covert
              attentional shifts at three different rates (0.2, 1.0, and 2.0
              Hz). At every shift rate, both overt and covert shifts of
              visuospatial attention induced activations in the precentral
              sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, and lateral occipital cortex that
              were of greater amplitude for overt than during covert shifting.
              As the rate of attentional shifts increased, responses in the
              visuospatial network increased in both overt and covert
              conditions but this parametric increase was greater during overt
              shifts. These results confirm that overt and covert attentional
              shifts are subserved by the same network of areas. Overt shifts
              of attention elicit more neural activity than do covert shifts,
              reflecting additional activity associated with saccade execution.
              An additional finding concerns the anatomical organization of the
              visuospatial network. Two distinct activation foci were observed
              within the precentral sulcus for both overt and covert
              attentional shifts, corresponding to specific anatomical
              landmarks. We therefore reappraise the correspondence of these

              visual search tasks is its separation in two stages. The first,
              early ``preattentive'' stage operates in parallel across the
              entire visual field extracting single ``primitive features''
              without integrating them. The second ``attentive'' stage
              corresponds to the specialized integration of information from a
              limited part of the field at any one time, i.e. serially. So far,
              models based on the above mentioned two-stage processes have been
              able to distinguish features from conjunction search conditions
              based on the observed slopes of the linear relation between
              reaction time (i.e., search time) and the number of items in the
              stimulus array. We propose a neuroscience based model for visual
              attention that works across the visual field in parallel, but due
              to its intrinsic dynamics can show the two experimentally
              observed modes of visual attention, namely: the serial focal
              attention and the parallel spread of attention over space. The
              model demonstrates that neither explicit serial focal search nor
              saliency maps need to be assumed. In the present model the focus
              of attention is not included in the system but only emerges after
              convergence of the dynamical behaviour of the neural networks.
              Furthermore, existing models have not been able to explain the
              variation of slopes observed in different kinds of conjunction
              search modes. We hypothesize that the different slopes can be
              explained by assuming that selective attention is guided by an
              independent mechanism which corresponds to the independent search
              for each feature. The model consistently integrates the different
              neuroscience levels by considering the microscopic neurodynamical
              mechanism that underlies visual attention, the different brain
              areas of the dorsal or ``where'' and ventral or ``what'' paths of
              the visual cortex, and behavioural data.",

              to different behaviours depending on the situation, or the same
              behaviour may be elicited by different cueing stimuli. Neurons in

              during working memory delay periods. These neurons provide a
              neural substrate for mapping stimulus and response in a flexible,

              different types of working-memory-related neuronal activity
              observed. The model contains different populations (or pools) of
              neurons (as found neurophysiologically) in attractor networks

              stimulus sensory properties (e.g. the object identity or object

              response errors when dopamine is elevated because there is less

              ``biased competition hypothesis'' of the neural basis of
              attention. According to this hypothesis, attention appears as a
              sometimes nonlinear property that results from a top-down biasing
              effect that influences the competitive and cooperative
              interactions that work both within cortical areas and between
              cortical areas. In this paper we describe a detailed dynamical
              analysis of the synaptic and neuronal spiking mechanisms
              underlying biased competition. We perform a detailed analysis of
              the dynamical capabilities of the system by exploring the
              stationary attractors in the parameter space by a mean-field
              reduction consistent with the underlying synaptic and spiking
              dynamics. The nonstationary dynamical behavior, as measured in
              neuronal recording experiments, is studied by an
              integrate-and-fire model with realistic dynamics. This elucidates
              the role of cooperation and competition in the dynamics of biased
              competition and shows why feedback connections between cortical
              areas need optimally to be weaker by a factor of about 2.5 than
              the feedforward connections in an attentional network. We modeled
              the interaction between top-down attention and bottom-up stimulus
              contrast effects found neurophysiologically and showed that
              top-down attentional effects can be explained by external
              attention inputs biasing neurons to move to different parts of
              their nonlinear activation functions. Further, it is shown that,
              although NMDA nonlinear effects may be useful in attention, they
              are not necessary, with nonlinear effects (which may appear
              multiplicative) being produced in the way just described.",

              the hypothesis that these parietal neurons encode the subjective

              expectancies is observed: There is an unusual delay in response
              time (RT) when expectancies mismatch---that is, when an
              unexpected (uncued) form appears at an expected (cued) position
              or an expected (cued) form appears at an unexpected (uncued)
              position. This interaction is inconsistent with the spatial
              spotlight model's prediction that position and form expectancy
              effects will be additive. The position-form interaction is
              eliminated when target position discriminability is made
              difficult by adding a distractor item at the location not
              containing a target (Experiment 2) or by decreasing the validity
              of the positional cue (Experiment 3). Decreasing the validity of

              Interestingly, this valid-versus-invalid RT difference increases
              as the percentage of valid trials increases. In the present
              study, we investigated the mechanism responsible for this
              proportion valid cueing effect (PVE). The PVE is thought to
              reflect changes in voluntary attentional allocation, with greater
              attention being committed endogenously to the cued location as
              the percentage of valid trials increases. However, recent
              research has suggested that the PVE may reflect a form of
              implicit learning between the cue and the target location that is
              developed outside of awareness, and that this determines how
              attention is allocated. This lack of convergence may be due to
              methodological differences in how voluntary processing has been
              inferred. To test this issue, we generated a method that would
              allow the measurement of different degrees of volitional
              attention. In addition, we manipulated whether participants were
              instructed to attend to the cue-target relationship and

              influenced the PVE. We found that for both peripheral and central
              cues, volitional control is not required for a PVE; however,
              volitional control can modulate a PVE that is produced by central
              cues. Thus, a PVE is not a reliable indicator of volitional
              control, but its sensitivity to volitional control varies across
              cues. The present data shed light on the mechanism subserving the
              PVE and lend support to the theory that different cues engage, to
              some degree, qualitatively different forms of visuospatial

              concerning interactions between associative learning and
              attention in humans. Four main findings are described. First,
              attention is biased toward stimuli that predict their
              consequences reliably (learned predictiveness). This finding is
              consistent with the approach taken by Mackintosh (1975) in his
              attentional model of associative learning in nonhuman animals.
              Second, the strength of this attentional bias is modulated by the
              value of the outcome (learned value). That is, predictors of
              high-value outcomes receive especially high levels of attention.
              Third, the related but opposing idea that uncertainty may result
              in increased attention to stimuli (Pearce \& Hall, 1980),
              receives less support. This suggests that hybrid models of
              associative learning, incorporating the mechanisms of both the
              Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall theories, may not be required to
              explain data from human participants. Rather, a simpler model, in
              which attention to stimuli is determined by how strongly they are
              associated with significant outcomes, goes a long way to account
              for the data on human attentional learning. The last main
              finding, and an exciting area for future research and theorizing,
              is that learned predictiveness and learned value modulate both
              deliberate attentional focus, and more automatic attentional
              capture. The automatic influence of learning on attention does
              not appear to fit the traditional view of attention as being
              either goal-directed or stimulus-driven. Rather, it suggests a
              new kind of ``derived'' attention.",

              locations for further processing. The results of a series of
              experiments with monkeys performing visual search tasks have
              identified a population of frontal eye field (FEF) visually
              responsive neurons that exhibit all of the characteristics of a
              visual salience map. The activity of these FEF neurons is not
              sensitive to specific features of visual stimuli; but instead,
              their activity evolves over time to select the target of the
              search array. This selective activation reflects both the
              bottom-up intrinsic conspicuousness of the stimuli and the
              top-down knowledge and goals of the viewer. The peak response
              within FEF specifies the target for the overt gaze shift.
              However, the selective activity in FEF is not in itself a motor
              command because the magnitude of activation reflects the relative
              behavioral significance of the different stimuli in the visual
              scene and occurs even when no saccade is made. Identifying a
              visual salience map in FEF validates the theoretical concept of a
              salience map in many models of attention. In addition, it
              strengthens the emerging view that FEF is not only involved in

              the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the

              which the currently attended location is prevented from being
              attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment.

               null-hypothesis testing is as widespread as ever. Despite this

               aware of the statistical peculiarities of thep value procedure.
               In particular,p values are based on data that were never
               observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced
               by subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify
               statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems
               and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three
               problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to
               psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is
               to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian

              the suggestion that rewards belong to a class of attentional cues
              based on selection history, which are defined by past outcomes
              with a stimulus feature. Selection history is thought to be
              separate from traditional attentional cues based on physical

              understanding of how selection history operates as a mechanism of

              how multiple sources of selection history interact when presented
              simultaneously. For example, it may be easier to find something
              we like if it also appears in a predictable location. We
              therefore pitted spatial probabilities against reward

              need to be evaluated on individual datasets. This approach will

              This is relevant when using the free energy as an approximation
              to the log-evidence in Bayesian model averaging and selection. By
              setting restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) in the larger
              context of variational learning and expectation maximisation
              (EM), we show how the ReML objective function can be adjusted to
              provide an approximation to the log-evidence for a particular
              model. This means ReML can be used for model selection,
              specifically to select or compare models with different
              covariance components. This is useful in the context of
              hierarchical models because it enables a principled selection of
              priors that, under simple hyperpriors, can be used for automatic
              model selection and relevance determination (ARD). Deriving the

              nonlinear input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear
              approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the
              parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets.
              These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the influence of
              extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate
              intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear]
              parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling.
              Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known,
              deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We
              developed this approach for the analysis of effective
              connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and fMRI
              responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to
              effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reflect the
              changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework
              allows one to characterise fMRI experiments, conceptually, as an
              experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by
              contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set)
              that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or
              trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of
              effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced
              changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions).
              However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal
              model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as

              (14 cases), the head of the caudate (1 case), and the ventral
              putamen (3 cases). Retrogradely labeled cells were located
              predominantly in layer 5 of the ipsilateral cortex but were also
              found in layers 3 and 6. After caudate injections, labeled cells
              were found both in large, nearly continuous regions of cortex
              topographically related to the site of the injection, and in
              several smaller cortical regions that were discontinuous and

              injections into the posterior tail and ventral genu, the labeled
              region shifted posteriorly in TE and TF, and into TEO and the
              ventral parts of prestriate areas V4, V3, and (sparsely) V2. As

              prestriate areas MT and PO, parietal area PG (Brodmann's area 7),

              proposals regarding the functional architecture of the visual

              broadly complementary, aspects of attention: maintaining
              attentive control on current task goals as well as responding to
              salient new information or alerting stimuli in the environment.
              In our view, findings from functional imaging,
              electrophysiological and lesion studies are all consistent with
              the view that this region is part of a system that allows
              flexible reconfiguration of behaviour between these two
              alternative modes of operation. Damage to the right IPL leads to
              deficits in both maintaining attention and also responding to

              roles of the two circuits in visual information processing are
              not well understood. To address this question, we have applied

              distinct functional characteristics of the two visual circuits.
              RF diameters of SC neurons were significantly larger than those
              of V1 cells. Most cells in both regions had high orientation
              selectivity, but the mean orientation bandwidth of the SC was
              broader than that of V1 cells (101.5° vs. 60.2°). The mean
              optimal spatial frequency (SF) of SC cells was lower but had a
              broader bandwidth than that of V1 cells (0.03 vs. 0.068 cpd). The
              majority of SC and V1 cells (70\% and 68\%, respectively) had RFs

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Executive control of voluntary movements is a
              hallmark of the mammalian brain. In the gaze-control network,
              this function is thought to be mediated by a critical balance
              between neurons responsible for generating movements and those
              responsible for fixating or suppressing movements, but the nature
              of this balance between the relevant elements-saccade-generating
              and fixation-related neurons-remains unclear. Specifically, it
              has been debated whether the two functions are necessarily
              coupled (i.e., push-and-pull) or independently controlled. Here
              we show that behavioral perturbation of ongoing fixation with the
              trigeminal blink reflex in monkeys (Macaca mulatta) alters the
              effective balance between fixation and saccade-generating neurons
              in the superior colliculus (SC) and can lead to premature gaze
              shifts reminiscent of compromised inhibitory control. The shift
              in balance is primarily driven by an increase in the activity of
              visuomovement neurons in the caudal SC, and the extent to which
              fixation-related neurons in the rostral SC play a role seems to
              be linked to the animal's propensity to make microsaccades. The
              perturbation also reveals a hitherto unknown feature of
              sensorimotor integration: the presence of a hidden visual
              response in canonical movement neurons. These findings offer new
              insights into the latent functional interactions, or lack
              thereof, between components of the gaze-control network,
              suggesting that the perturbation technique used here may prove to
              be a useful tool for probing the neural mechanisms of movement
              generation in executive function and dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT: Eye movements are an integral part of how we explore
              the environment. Although we know a great deal about where
              sensorimotor transformations leading to saccadic eye movements
              are implemented in the brain, less is known about the functional
              interactions between neurons that maintain gaze fixation and
              neurons that program saccades. In this study, we used a novel
              approach to study these interactions. By transient disruption of
              fixation, we found that activity of saccade-generating neurons
              can increase independently of modulation in fixation-related
              neurons, which may occasionally lead to premature movements
              mimicking lack of impulse control. Our findings support the
              notion of a common pathway for sensory and movement processing
              and suggest that impulsive movements arise when sensory processes
              become ``motorized.''",

              the cortical lesion demonstrates that neither assumption is

              attention is biased toward stimuli that predict their
              consequences reliably (). This finding is consistent with the
              approach taken by Mackintosh (1975) in his attentional model of
              associative learning in nonhuman animals. Second, the strength of
              this attentional bias is modulated by the value of the outcome
              (). That is, predictors of high-value outcomes receive especially
              high levels of attention. Third, the related but opposing idea
              that may result in increased attention to stimuli (Pearce \&
              Hall, 1980), receives less support. This suggests that hybrid
              models of associative learning, incorporating the mechanisms of
              both the Mackintosh and Pearce-Hall theories, may not be required
              to explain data from human participants. Rather, a simpler model,
              in which attention to stimuli is determined by how strongly they
              are associated with significant outcomes, goes a long way to
              account for the data on human attentional learning. The last main
              finding, and an exciting area for future research and theorizing,
              is that and modulate both deliberate attentional focus, and more
              automatic attentional capture. The automatic influence of
              learning on attention does not appear to fit the traditional view

              effects of mental set are proving more pervasive than was
              previously suspected, whereas automaticity is proving less
              robust. Stimulus attributes (e.g. onsets, transients) thought to

              have been shown to capture attention only as a consequence of
              voluntarily adopted task sets. Recent research suggests that
              practice does not have as dramatic effects as is commonly

               in trained categories (Exp 1). However, when arbitrary sets of

               substantially retards performance (Exp 2), even when the size of

              started at 220 ms after cue onset and preceded suppression of the

              Psychophysical investigations have revealed that observers can
              select target elements from within an array of distractors on the
              basis of their spatial location or simple features, such as
              color. It remains unclear, however, how stimuli that lie outside
              the current search array are represented in the visual system. To
              investigate this, we recorded continuous neural activity using
              EEG while participants searched a foveal array of colored targets
              and distractors, and ignored irrelevant objects in the periphery.
              Search targets were defined either by a unique feature within the

              could match the target or distractor color within the array, or

  abstract = "Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a
              system capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the
              experimenter. Detection latencies are reduced when subjects
              receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the signal
              will occur. This shift in efficiency appears to be due to an
              alignment (orienting) of the central attentional system with the
              pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would also be
              possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced
              criterion at the expected target position. However, this
              description ignores important constraints about the way in which
              expectancy improves performance. First, when subjects are cued on
              each trial, they show stronger expectancy effects than when a
              probable position is held constant for a block, indicating the
              active nature of the expectancy. Second, while information on
              spatial position improves performance, information on the form of
              the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to improvements
              in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth, there appears
              to be little ability to lower the criterion at two positions that
              are not spatially contiguous. A framework involving the
              employment of a limited-capacity attentional mechanism seems to
              capture these constraints better than the more general language
              of criterion setting. Using this framework, we find that
              attention shifts are not closely related to the saccadic eye
              movement system. For luminance detection the retina appears to be
              equipotential with respect to attention shifts, since costs to
              unexpected stimuli are similar whether foveal or peripheral.
              These results appear to provide an important model system for the
              study of the relationship between attention and the structure of
              the visual system.",

  abstract = "It is well established that attention modulates visual processing
              in extrastriate cortex. However, the underlying neural mechanisms
              are unknown. A consistent observation is that attention has its
              greatest impact on neuronal responses when multiple stimuli
              appear together within a cell's receptive field. One way to
              explain this is to assume that multiple stimuli activate
              competing populations of neurons and that attention biases this
              competition in favor of the attended stimulus. In the absence of
              competing stimuli, there is no competition to be resolved.
              Accordingly, attention has a more limited effect on the neuronal
              response to a single stimulus. To test this interpretation, we
              measured the responses of neurons in macaque areas V2 and V4
              using a behavioral paradigm that allowed us to isolate automatic
              sensory processing mechanisms from attentional effects. First, we
              measured each cell's response to a single stimulus presented
              alone inside the receptive field or paired with a second
              receptive field stimulus, while the monkey attended to a location
              outside the receptive field. Adding the second stimulus typically
              caused the neuron's response to move toward the response that was
              elicited by the second stimulus alone. Then, we directed the
              monkey's attention to one element of the pair. This drove the
              neuron's response toward the response elicited when the attended
              stimulus appeared alone. These findings are consistent with the
              idea that attention biases competitive interactions among
              neurons, causing them to respond primarily to the attended

              involuntarily, through attentional capture driven by physical
              salience (e.g., looking toward a sudden noise). Valuable stimuli

              context independent. However, decisions between two high-value
              options can be suboptimally biased by the introduction of a third
              low-value option. This context-dependent modulation is consistent
              with the divisive normalization of the value of each stimulus by
              the total value of all stimuli. In addition, an independent line
              of research demonstrates that pairing a stimulus with a
              high-value outcome can lead to attentional capture that can
              mediate the efficiency of visual information processing. Here we
              tested the hypothesis that value-based attentional capture
              interacts with value-based normalization to influence the
              optimality of decision-making. We used a binary-choice paradigm
              in which observers selected between two targets and the color of
              each target indicated the magnitude of their reward potential.
              Observers also had to simultaneously ignore a task-irrelevant
              distractor rendered in a color that was previously associated
              with a specific reward magnitude. When the color of the
              task-irrelevant distractor was previously associated with a high
              reward, observers responded more slowly and less optimally.
              Moreover, as the learned value of the distractor increased,
              electrophysiological data revealed an attenuation of the
              lateralized N1 and N2Pc responses evoked by the relevant choice
              stimuli and an attenuation of the late positive deflection (LPD).

              faster and more accurately, facilitating the selection of
              appropriate behavioral responses. Information processing is also
              strongly influenced by past experience and recent studies
              indicate that the learned value of a stimulus can influence
              relatively late stages of decision making such as the process of
              selecting a motor response. However, the learned value of a
              stimulus can also influence the magnitude of cortical responses
              in early sensory areas such as V1 and S1. These early effects of
              stimulus value are presumed to improve the quality of sensory
              representations; however, the nature of these modulations is not
              clear. They could reflect nonspecific changes in response
              amplitude associated with changes in general arousal or they
              could reflect a bias in population responses so that high-value
              features are represented more robustly. To examine this issue,
              subjects performed a two-alternative forced choice paradigm with
              a variable-interval payoff schedule to dynamically manipulate the
              relative value of two stimuli defined by their orientation (one
              was rotated clockwise from vertical, the other counterclockwise).
              Activation levels in visual cortex were monitored using
              functional MRI and feature-selective voxel tuning functions while
              subjects performed the behavioral task. The results suggest that
              value not only modulates the relative amplitude of responses in
              early areas of human visual cortex, but also sharpens the
              response profile across the populations of feature-selective
              neurons that encode the critical stimulus feature (orientation).
              Moreover, changes in space- or feature-based attention cannot
              easily explain the results because representations of both the
              selected and the unselected stimuli underwent a similar
              feature-selective modulation. This sharpening in the population

              evoked oscillatory activity. Early in training, the visually
              evoked oscillations relate to the physical parameters of the
              stimuli. However, with training, the oscillations evolve to
              relate the time in which those stimuli foretell expected reward.
              Moreover, the oscillation prevalence reflects the reward rate
              recently experienced by the animal. Thus, training induces
              experience-dependent changes in V1 activity that relate to what
              those stimuli have come to signify behaviorally: when to expect
              future reward and at what rate.",

  abstract = "Stimuli associated with high rewards evoke stronger neuronal
              activity than stimuli associated with lower rewards in many brain
              regions. It is not well understood how these reward effects
              influence activity in sensory cortices that represent low-level
              stimulus features. Here, we investigated the effects of reward
              information in the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys. We
              found that the reward value of a stimulus relative to the value
              of other stimuli is a good predictor of V1 activity. Relative
              value biases the competition between stimuli, just as has been
              shown for selective attention. The neuronal latency of this
              reward value effect in V1 was similar to the latency of
              attentional influences. Moreover, V1 neurons with a strong value
              effect also exhibited a strong attention effect, which implies
              that relative value and top-down attention engage overlapping, if
              not identical, neuronal selection mechanisms. Our findings
              demonstrate that the effects of reward value reach down to the
              earliest sensory processing levels of the cerebral cortex and
              imply that theories about the effects of reward coding and
              top-down attention on visual representations should be unified.",
